# Rise (and Fall?) of China's Demand for Imported Timber: A Network Analysis of the International Roundwood Trade

## Paper in brief

**Authors**: Valentin Mathieu, David Shanafelt

**Abstract**:

The international trade of wood products is an increasingly complex and interdependent component of the global economy, deeply linked to environmental issues, geopolitical shifts, changing competitive landscape, and macroeconomic trends.
While the literature offers comprehensive studies on the international timber trade, few to date consider the physical structure of the trade network in their analyses, leaving its structural evolution poorly understood.
To address this gap, we employ a network-theoretic approach to model global roudnwood trade flows between countries, providing a unique diagnosis of the trade's key structural properties and their temporal evolution from 1996 to 2023.
The analysis reveals that the network has developed short-term resilience while becoming consistently more interconnected and structurally concentrated over the long term.
Crucially, the structure is highly polarized around China's market dominance, which rapidly grew to concentrate over 56% of total trade value by 2021, due to its import demand.
This centralization, coupled with the structural withdrawal of major exporter Russia, created a single point of vulnerability in the global supply chain.
The recent decline in China's contribution post-2021—a result of geopolitical shocks, domestic self-sufficiency policies, and structural economic shifts—signals a fundamental shift in the international roundwood trade.
These findings underscore the need for exporters to implement market diversification strategies to mitigate policy risks in the global roundwood value chain.

## Folder structure
The folder is organized as follows:

```

README.md provides information on the repository structuration and explains the data analysis workflow.
dag.pdf presents the directed graph of jobs in the workflow.
preprint.pdf is the preprint of the paper, also available on HAL.
 
The workflow code goes into a subfolder `workflow`, while the configuration is stored in a subfolder `config`. 
Inside of the `workflow` subfolder, the central `Snakefile` marks the entrypoint of the workflow (it will be automatically discovered when running snakemake from the root of above structure). 
In addition to the central `Snakefile`, rules are stored in a modular way, using the subfolder `workflow/rules`. 
Such modules should end with `.smk`, the recommended file extension of Snakemake. 
Further, scripts are stored in a subfolder `workflow/scripts`. 
Conda environments are stored in the subfolder `workflow/envs` (they are kept as finegrained as possible to improve transparency and maintainability).
The `config` subfolder contains a `requirement.txt` text file that lists the required packages, and a `config.yaml` file that contains all parameters needed for the workflow.

All output files generated in the workflow are stored under `results`, unless they are rather retrieved resources, in which case they should be stored under `resources`. 
The latter subfolder also contains small resources that shall be delivered along with the workflow via git, sorted into inhouse data, public data, and- if it is the case- private data.
The `results` subfolder separate `global` output that consists into resources that have been sorted, cleaned, and possibly arranged. The `results/network_analysis` sort workflow output in input data, intermediary data (typically intermediary object that yield final outputs), output, and plots.
