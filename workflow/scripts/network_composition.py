def unit_network_composition(

    '''
    Function that returns a polar data frame of the network composition 
    descriptive statistics (number of trading countries, number of pure 
    exporters, number of pure importers, number of countries that are both 
    exporters and importers) based on an edge list describing a trade network 
    for a given year and traded product. The network refers to the trade of one
    year and one product and is directed and unweighted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    unit_edge_list_dict : dictionnary
        A dictionnary that associates (i) a tuple (cmd, period) of the commodity
        code and the year of trade and (ii) the associated edge list describing 
        the network and on which network composition descriptive statistics are
        calculated.

    Returns
    -------
    unit_network_composition : pl.dataframe.frame.DataFrame
        A polars data frame of the network composition descriptive statistics 
        for a given year of trade and traded product.
