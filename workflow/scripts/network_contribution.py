    '''
    Function that returns a polar data frame of a country's contribution to 
    total traded value for exports and imports and total number of edges based 
    on an edge list describing a trade network for a given year and traded 
    product. The weight to be taken into account when calculating the total 
    traded value is given by the weight parameter. The network refers to the 
    trade of one year and one product and is directed and weighted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    unit_edge_list_dict : dictionnary
        A dictionnary that associates (i) a tuple (cmd, period) of the commodity
        code and the year of trade and (ii) the associated edge list describing 
        the network and on which network total traded value and market 
        concentration indices are calculated.
    to_omit : string
        The name of the country on which network contribution is calculated,
        i.e., the country to omit in order to measure its contribution in the
        netork total traded value and number of edges.
    weight : string
        The weight on which network total traded value and market concentration 
        indices are calculated. The default value is "primary_value".

    Returns
    -------
    unit_market_concentration : polars data frame
        A polars data frame of a country's contribution to total traded value 
        for exports and imports and total number of edges for a given year and 
        traded product.
