The uneven global distribution of forest resources, concentrated in a few countries (*e.g.*, Russia, Brazil, Canada, the United States, and China) [@fao_state_2024], necessitates international trade to balance supply and demand to satisfy domestic consumption [@long_exploring_2019; @huang_static_2024].\n\n<!--Economic expansion: Trade growth dynamics and its drivers-->\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed significant acceleration in international wood product trade, driven by convergent economic and technological determinants. Primary drivers include sustained global economic growth, escalating demand for construction materials fueled by urbanization, trade liberalization, and technological innovations enhancing forestry value chain operational efficiency[^1] [@prestemon_international_2003; @unecefao_forest_2022-1]. Furthermore, global value chains (GVC) proliferation has restructured production paradigms through the spatial fragmentation of manufacturing processes, leading to new market dynamics and more complex supply chain configurations [@amador_networks_2017].\n\n[^1]: These innovations encompass advancements in plantation management systems, forest harvesting operations, and manufacturing processes.\n\n<!--Trade potential environmental impact-->\n\nThis trade intensification has precipitated systematic displacement of deforestation pressures, characterized by distinct geographic redistribution patterns. Resource accumulation occurs in nations with predominantly non-indigenous, plantation-based forest systems — typically developed economies with established silviculture infrastructure — while simultaneously exerting extractive pressure on regions where indigenous forest ecosystems face depletion, predominantly within developing nations [@prestemon_international_2003; @leblois_what_2017; @pendrill_deforestation_2019; @abman_does_2020]. This spatial divergence highlights how trade-mediated demand drives forest degradation. In particular, illegal logging and associated trade represent significant drivers of deforestation and forest degradation globally, exacerbating climate change [@lawson_illegal_2010].[^2]\n\n[^2]: Illegal logging and its associated trade also extensively contribute to wider environmental damage, such as global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, loss of biodiversity, deprive governments of billions of dollars in vital revenues, foster corruption, undermine the rule of law, and can fuel conflict [@lawson_illegal_2010].\n\n<!--Ecological consideration: an increase in global environmental consciousness concerning forests-->\n\nThis acceleration of the international wood trade has also coincided with growing environmental consciousness and a rising preference for \"green\" materials with carbon storage capacity, driven by climate change mitigation goals, leading to various environmental regulations and sustainability initiatives [@prestemon_international_2003]. The emerging forest-based bioeconomy, exemplified by strategies like the European Bioeconomy Strategy, aims to replace non-renewable resources with high-value-added products from woody biomass [@wolfslehner_forest_2016; @winkel_towards_2017]. This creates a paradox: while increased wood demand can support decarbonization and sustainable development, unsustainable and illegally sourcing risks exacerbating deforestation and forest degradation. Consequently, market-based tools like forest certification schemes[^3] promote sustainable practices, sometimes restricting wood products trade [@guan_restricting_2019; @chen_effect_2020; @boubacar_sustainable_2025]. Furthermore, timber trade regulations, primarily enforced by developed countries, aim to exclude illegal timber from domestic markets, hindering trade volumes [@moral-pajares_transparency_2020; @rougieux_impacts_2021; @apeti_impact_2023; @kim_analyzing_2024].[^4]\n\n[^3]: Such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).\n\n[^4]: Examples are the European Union’s Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR), the US Lacey Act, the Australia Illegal Logging Prohibition Act, or the Japan Clean Wood Act.\n\n<!--The increasing weight of non-tariff barriers and trade disputes-->\n\nWhile tariff barriers have declined due to international trade agreements, these trade regulations demonstrate that non-tariff barriers (NTBs) increasingly influence wood product trade [@unecefao_forest_2022-1]. NTBs include quotas, embargoes, economic sanctions, export bans, stringent environmental policies, and phytosanitary controls [@li_potential_2007; @sun_impacts_2010; @buongiorno_potential_2018; @unecefao_forest_2022; @fao_global_2024]. Notable trade disputes over wood products, such as those between China and the U.S. [@muhammad_end_2021; @pan_impacts_2021], Russian roundwood export restrictions [@turner_implications_2008; @solberg_forest_2010; @lin_incidence_2017; @guan_impact_2024], and the Canada-U.S. softwood lumber dispute [@van_kooten_global_2014; @johnston_impact_2017], underscore a tension between free trade principles and national policy objectives. Such measures, while often aiming for sustainability or industry protection, can disrupt trade, raise prices, and shift production and consumption patterns.\n\n<!--Trade disruptions faced-->\n\nIn recent years, significant economic and geopolitical disruptions have affected the global supply chain for wood products, leading to volatility in timber prices and shipping costs [@fao_global_2024; @unecefao_forest_2022]. The COVID-19 pandemic initially introduced considerable uncertainty into forest product markets but was swiftly followed by a robust economic rebound in 2021, indicating strong underlying demand and inherent resilience [@unecefao_forest_2022]. However, the war in Ukraine from mid-2022 exacerbated supply chain disruptions, intensified inflation, and eroded consumer confidence, leading to a demand decline [@unecefao_forest_2022]. Climate change impact on forests ecosystems worsens such instability, increasing the frequency and severity of natural disturbances like storms, wildfires, and pest outbreaks [@seidl_unraveling_2011; @seidl_climate_2017; @curtis_classifying_2018; @tyukavina_global_2022; @patacca_significant_2023], directly disrupting timber supply chains and market stability and deteriorating wood quality [@garcia-jacome_forest_2025]. This apparent vulnerability to external shocks suggests that trade resilience is not absolute but contingent on global economic, environmental, and political stability [@garcia-jacome_forest_2025; @ma_modelling_2025].\n\n<!--SCIENTIFIC ISSUES-->\n\n<!--A comprehensive study from the literature-->\n\nUnderstanding the intricate web of these relationships and trade flows is paramount for policy formulation and strategic planning. The literature extensively studies the international timber market and trade, spanning from global to subnational scales and various wood products [*e.g.*, @muller_longterm_2004; @raunikar_global_2010; @caurla_stimulating_2013; @van_kooten_global_2014; @buongiorno_global_2015; @rougieux_modelling_2017; @rougieux_impacts_2021; @shen_structural_2022]. These studies employ three primary perspectives: trade mechanism analysis, forecasting, and policy analysis [@buongiorno_gravity_2016; @riviere_representations_2020; @mathieu_meta-analysis_2023].\n\n<!--Reliance on models -->\n\nOverall, the literature on international wood trade draws on models. Traditional approaches, primarily forest sector models and econometric models (including gravity models) rooted in economic theory [@buongiorno_forest_1996; @kallio_global_2004; @latta_review_2013; @northway_forest_2013; @buongiorno_global_2015], rely on nationally reported data and treat countries as the main unit of analysis, focusing on discrete bilateral trade relationships [@amador_networks_2017; @shen_structural_2022].\n\n<!--Limits of current practices-->\n\nHowever, these approaches face significant limitations in accounting for multilateral network effects, indirect trade linkages, and cascading interdependencies inherent in modern international trade and contemporary global value chain structures [@de_benedictis_world_2011; @amador_networks_2017; @liu_spatial-temporal_2025]. Consequently, traditional approaches offer limited structural insights and may systematically underestimate critical systemic vulnerabilities such as supply chain fragility, contagion effects, and network resilience, while simultaneously overlooking strategic opportunities revealed by comprehensive network topology analysis [@fevre_animal_2006; @huang_static_2024]. Furthermore, the existing literature exhibits considerable heterogeneity in analytical frameworks, temporal specifications, and spatial delimitations, hindering systematic meta-analysis and comprehensive understanding of global trade network dynamics.\n\n<!--Network approach-->\n\nWe address this gap by adopting a network theoretic approach that considers the trade flows between countries as the unit of analysis [@de_benedictis_world_2011; @amador_networks_2017]. This perspective offers a deeper, holistic view of wood product trade inherent structure, providing insights into its underlying organization and evolution [@long_exploring_2019; @shen_structural_2022]. Indeed, network analysis has been a powerful tool for studying complex global interactions.[^5]\n\n[^5]: See, for example, [@fevre_animal_2006], who construct networks of the live animal trade to explain the spread of disease.\n\n<!--Existing network analysis-->\n\nNetwork analysis has significantly advanced the understanding of global wood forest product trade dynamics, moving beyond traditional economic models to reveal structural characteristics, intricate relationships, competitive dynamics, evolutionary trends, network resilience to external shocks, and vulnerabilities [@lovric_social_2018; @long_exploring_2019; @gao_trade_2024; @huang_static_2024]. Previous research indicates these trade networks have significantly evolved and expanded in the 21st century, showing increased complexity and interdependence, broader participation, and enhanced overall trade efficiency and resilience [@wang_exploratory_2020; @gao_trade_2024; @huang_static_2024; @liu_analysis_2024]. While network density remains stable, average trade value has risen [@zhou_spatial_2021].\n\nNetwork analysis has also identified key players and their evolving roles. Historically, North American and European countries were central, but emerging economies like China have become dominant importers and increasingly central players across the supply chain, with their influence growing annually [@zhou_spatial_2021; @gao_trade_2024; @huang_static_2024; @liu_analysis_2024]. Russia and Canada remain major timber exporters, and New Zealand is a significant raw material exporter [@zhou_spatial_2021]. Despite dynamic changes, these networks maintain a relatively stable core-periphery structure, with China and India now prominent in the core [@wang_exploratory_2020]. While core countries boost network resilience, their dominance introduces vulnerabilities [@huang_static_2024].\n\nBeyond structural descriptions, the literature has also investigated factors influencing network evolution, including economic scale, geographical distance, cultural differences, and forest resource endowment [@gao_trade_2024], internal trade effects (reciprocity and transitivity) [@shen_structural_2022], and policy changes [@huang_static_2024].\n\n<!--Going beyond-->\n\nCurrent research on forest product trade networks, while foundational, needs deeper methodological and empirical exploration. Most studies take a broad, macroscopic view, often combining different wood product types, potentially distorting network understanding and leading to less effective trade policies [@gao_trade_2024; @liu_analysis_2024]. A significant gap exists in comprehensively characterizing the structure and temporal evolution of international roundwood trade networks. This gap is critical because roundwood — unprocessed timber directly harvested from forests — represents the primary commodity in global forest product supply chains, directly linked to sustainable forest management and deforestation issues. As the second most traded wood product by volume over the last decade,[^6] roundwood forms the foundational stratum of international forest product trade, linking forest resource extraction with processing industries through complex international trade relationships. The lack of detailed analysis on roundwood trade patterns, both structurally and over time, is a major gap in forest economics research, limiting policy insights for sustainable forest governance.\n\n[^6]: According to FAOSTAT data.\n\n<!--What we do to fill the gap-->\n\nThe present work addresses this gap through a comprehensive network analysis of global roundwood trade dynamics spanning the period 1996–2023. First, we conduct a multidimensional network topology analysis using complementary quantitative metrics to systematically characterize roundwood trade network structural properties and their temporal evolution. This employs graph theory-based methodologies alongside traditional trade analysis metrics for comprehensive structural characterization. Second, we use information of past market behaviour to explain changes in network structure. We hypothesise that global roundwood trade networks demonstrate systematic concentration in exports (due to concentrated forest endowments) while exhibiting structural sensitivity to exogenous disruption events, including economic crises, geopolitical instabilities, and natural disasters. This hypothesis framework incorporates three propositions: (1) network concentration in exports remains moderately high over the study period; (2) trade network demonstrates systematic vulnerability to major disruption events; and (3) trade network demonstrates short-term structural recovery patterns following disruption events.\n\n# Material and methods\n\n## Bilateral trade data collection\n\nWe extracted trade data from the UN Comtrade database in Python 3.12.2 using the Python package \"comtradeapicall\" 1.2.1 [@untradestats_comtradeapicall_2024].[^7] The UN Comtrade data provides detailed information on bilateral trade flows by recording the trade reports from more than 200 countries. National statistical reports of trade may be produced on an annual or monthly basis. They cover a wide range of traded commodities, including wood products. Traded commodities are commonly classified under the Harmonized System (HS) nomenclature [@world_customs_organization_international_1983]. The HS nomenclature encodes each commodity under a 6-digit code, classifying them into chapters (2 digits), headings (4 digits), and subheadings (6 digits). Each trade flow is described through a set of information, including:\n\n[^7]: The Python package \"comtradeapicall\" extracts and downloads UN Comtrade data through API calls.\n\n-   the reporter, *i.e.*, the country that reports the trade flow;\n-   the partner, *i.e.*, the country with which the reporter trades;\n-   the period of reporting, *i.e.*, year of trade and, if reported monthly, month of trade;\n-   the type of trade flow, *i.e.*, import, export, re-import, re-export\n-   the product HS code and description\n-   the trade flow's net weight and traded value (in current US dollars)\n\nSince its creation, the HS nomenclature has been updated approximately every five years. It currently comprises six editions (1996, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2022). Each update to the HS nomenclature may result in changes to commodity codes. For instance, new products may be added, some products may be removed due to, for example, low trade volume, or a product may be specified more precisely and divided into several products.[^8] Although there are corresponding tables between different editions of the HS nomenclature, tracking its evolution is difficult, and changes in product nomenclature can result in gaps in time series.\n\n[^8]: For instance, between the 2007 and the 2012 HS nomenclature editions, the product \"Sawdust and wood waste and scrap, whether or not agglomerated in logs, briquettes, pellets or similar forms\" (code 440130) was subdivided into \"Wood pellets\" (code 440131) and \"Other sawdust and wood waste and scrap, whether or not agglomerated in logs, briquettes, pellets or similar forms\" (code 440139).\n\nFurthermore, although the HS nomenclature provides a common language for trade in all commodities between more than 200 countries, it can lack relevance to industry sectors. Wood products, for example, may be grouped together with bamboo materials or plastic furniture in a single chapter. To ensure consistency, we base our extraction on the sector-specific 2022 FAO Classification of Forest Products [@fao_classification_2022], which provides corresponding tables between the FAO classification and the 2017 and 2022 HS nomenclatures. We extract the corresponding HS product codes for FAO code 012, \"Wood in the rough other than wood fuel\" (hereafter referred to as \"roundwood\"), and we ensure consistency between different HS codes across the successive editions of the HS nomenclature.[^9] The correspondence between FAO product code 012 and HS product codes across successive HS nomenclature editions is provided in supplementary material X. All trade flows are then aggregated by FAO product code, enabling the analysis to focus on roundwood trade flows as defined by the FAO's Classification of Forest Products. This approach ensures the sectorial relevance and continuity of the time series for the analysis.\n\n[^9]: Data were extracted on October 2025.\n\nAs country reports in the UN Comtrade database can be updated or corrected within two years, we collect trade data from 1996 to 2023 to base our analysis on consolidated data. We only extract data on imports and exports. We also remove poorly specified trade flows, *e.g.*, those with a \"non-elsewhere specified\" (NES) partners. Finally, to reduce the noise in the data and remove unrealistic trade flows,[^10] we remove the 5% of trade flows with the lowest net weight or value from the dataset. <!--The complete data acquisition workflow is presented in @fig-data-aquisition-workflow.-->\n\n[^10]: For example, unrealistic trade flows typically correspond to trade flows with a net weight of a few kilograms.\n\n<!--\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Data acquisition workflow.}\n\\label{fig:data-aquisition-workflow}\n\\end{figure}-->\n\n## Trade network building from bilateral trade data\n\nBased on this data, we define the roundwood trade network for each year by computing edge lists. In network theory, an edge list is a mathematical representation of a network, which is made up of nodes (*e.g.*, countries, individuals, or entities such as banks or websites) and edges or vertices (*e.g.*, the movement of goods or people between countries, physical interactions between people, or the exchange of information or money) [@albert_statistical_2002; @newman_structure_2003]. An example of an edge list for a simple network is provided in @fig-edge-list-unweighted. In our case, the edge lists are $N \\times 2$ matrices that correspond to a roundwood trade network with $N$ edges in year $t$. Each edge represents a trade flow (either export or import) between nodes (countries), from the country of origin (*i.e.*, the exporter, indexed $o$), to the country of destination, (*i.e.*, the importer, indexed $d$), in year $t \\in {1996,1998,…,2023}$. The elements of the edge list are nodes that represent countries that engaged in either the export or import of roundwood, in a given year $t$.\n\n![Illustration of an edge list, $E^U$, and its corresponding network graph for an \\textit{unweighted} and \\textit{directed} network of 5 nodes. In the edge list, each row corresponds to an edge from an origin (first column) to a destination (second column). In the network graph, circles indicate nodes and arrows the edges between them.](figures/fig-edge-list-unweighted.png){#fig-edge-list-unweighted width=\"100%\" fig-pos=\"t\"}\n\nWe take the roundwood trade network for each year of the data as a weighted and directed network, *i.e.*, we consider whether or not two countries are connected by trade, the direction of the trade flows, and the \"weight\" (or quantity/value) of the trade flows. In our case, we consider the traded value to be the \"weight\" of the trade flow. This is in contrast to using the net weight in metric tons, which is not an appropriate unit of volume for roundwood as the mass of the roundwood depends on its moisture content.[^11] Due to data discrepancies, the reported trade value from the exporter and importer of the same trade flow may differ for at least two reasons: (1) import reports are expressed as \"cost, insurance and freight\" (CIF), while export reports are expressed as \"free on board\" (FOB), which excludes CIF costs from trade value, leading to bilateral asymmetries; (2) one of the trading partners may not report the trade [@gaulier_baci_2010; @rougieux_forest_2017; @kallio_reliability_2018; @chen_advancing_2022; @mitikj_bridging_2024]. To minimise the bias that such inconsistencies may cause, we consider both the exporter's and importer's reports of trade: $a_{o,d}$ and $a_{d,o}$, respectively. The edge list corresponding to the weighted, directed trade network is now a matrix of size $N \\times 4$.[^12] Each row represents a trade flow for a given year $t$, including the country of origin, the country of destination, and the trade values reported by the exporter and importer, as shown in @fig-edge-list-weighted.[^13] We therefore define 28 edge lists to describe the roundwood trade network for each year of trade.\n\n[^11]: UN Comtrade data provides an alternative \"quantity\" variable (encoded *qty*) to the net weight of the trade flows. However, this variable is poorly reported: (i) units may differ depending on the reporter and range from cubic metres to metres to kilograms, and so on; (ii) the \"quantity\" variable is not recorded in 7.8% of the dataset.\n\n[^12]: In fact, edge lists are close to mirror flows that can be derived from bilateral trade data, such as that provided by the UN Comtrade database.\n\n[^13]: See @rayfield_connectivity_2011 and @thompson_loss_2017 for examples of this approach in ecological networks.\n\n![Illustration of an edge list, $E^W$, and its corresponding network graph for a \\textit{weighted} and \\textit{directed} trade network of 5 nodes. In the edge list, each row corresponds to an edge from an origin (first column) to a destination (second column) and include trade values reported by the country of origin (third column, red) and the country of destination (fourth column, blue). In the network graph, circles indicate nodes and arrows the edges between them.](figures/fig-edge-list-weighted.png){#fig-edge-list-weighted width=\"100%\" fig-pos=\"t\"}\n\n## Trade network properties assessment\n\nEdge lists and any other network objects or raw visualisations are often difficult to read and interpret. Alone, they do not enable a thorough analysis of the structure of a trade network. In order to assess the structural characteristics of trade networks, we computed a series of network metrics for each year, differentiating between exports and imports.[^14] The Python package \"networkx\" 3.4.2 [@hagberg_exploring_2008] is used to facilitate the measurement network metrics.\n\n[^14]: Considering directed networks enables analysis from either the origin (exporter) or destination (importer) country perspective, allowing exporter or importer trade behaviour to be inferred.\n\nFirst, we assess the composition of the trade network. For each year, we compute the total number of nodes in the network, *i.e.*, the total number of trading countries. These countries are then divided into three more detailed groups: pure exporters (countries that only export roundwood), pure importers (countries that only import roundwood) and mixed countries (countries that both export and import roundwood). To obtain more detailed information on the composition of the network, we then cross-reference the export and import values of each trading country accounting for at least 1% of to the global export or import value with the number of its export and import trading partners. This provides country trade profiles for each year, allowing trade behaviours and groups to be inferred and their evolution observed over time. This set of metrics provides a general overview of the roundwood trade network.\n\nSecondly, to understand the finer details of the network structure, we then computed a set of metrics that assess the connectivity of the trade network, *i.e.*, the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the number of connections per node [@albert_statistical_2002; @newman_structure_2003]. Again, we assess network connectivity differentiating exports and imports. The mean number of connections per node, or node degree, is an average indicator of the degree of connectedness of the network. A high mean number of connections per node means that each country in the network has, on average, a high number of trading partners. The variance of the number of connections per node provides additional information about the dispersion of the number of connections. If the variance is close to zero, then the nodes in the network have more or less the same degree. A high variance indicates that the degree of connectivity of countries largely deviates from the mean. Skewness provides information about the proportion of low to highly connected nodes in the network. If the skewness is negative, the network consists of a higher proportion of highly connected nodes. Conversely, if the skewness is positive, then the network has a higher proportion of lowly connected nodes. Zero skewness implies an equal ratio of low to high connected nodes. Kurtosis provides information on how the degree distribution compares with a normal distribution in terms of its \"tailedness\" or \"flatness\". A positive kurtosis[^15] indicates that tailed outliers are more prevalent than in a normal distribution, meaning countries that diverge from the mean are rare. Conversely, negative kurtosis corresponds to a situation in which outliers are common, *i.e.*, where most countries diverge from the mean.\n\n[^15]: We consider Fisher's definition of kurtosis. A Pearson's definition would have necessitated the comparison of kurtosis values with 3 instead of 0.\n\nLastly, we assess market concentration by combining our network approach with a traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman market concentration index (HHI). The HHI is defined as follows:\n\n$$\nHHI = \\sum^{N}_{i = 1} (MS_{i})^{2}\n$$ {#eq-HHI}\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of countries involved in trade and $MS_{i}$ the market share of the country $i$, that is, the ratio of the value traded by country $i$ to the global value traded. We computed two $HHI$, one for exports and one for imports. The $HHI$ values can range from $1/N$ to 1. According to the $HHI$ value, the US Federal Trade Commission differentiates three types of markets [@us_department_of_justice_and_the_federal_trade_commission_horizontal_2010]:\n\n-   An $HHI$ between 0.01 and 0.15 corresponds to an unconcentrated market, *i.e.*, a market with no anti-competitive effects presumed;\n-   An $HHI$ between 0.15 and 0.25 indicates a moderately concentrated market, *i.e.*, a market with potential or significant anti-competitive effects;\n-   An $HHI$ greater than 0.25 indicates a highly concentrated market, *i.e.*, a market with presumption of anti-competitive effects.\n\nTo obtain a more detailed understanding of market concentration, we calculated each country's annual contribution to the global trade value, *i.e.*, the reduction in total trade value if a given country were removed from the network. This is equivalent to estimating the share of total trade value that \"flows\" through a given country in a particular year. Consequently, the sum of all countries’ contributions does not add up to 100%, due to the bilateral nature of trade flows. This approach allows us to identify dominant countries in the roundwood trade. In cases of high market concentration, the removal of a dominant country is expected to result in a substantial loss in trade value.\n\nCombining multiple complementary metrics offers a more comprehensive understanding of the network’s structure than any single metric alone can provide [@shanafelt_-it-yourself_2017; @salau_taking_2022]. For example, networks may have the same average number of connections but exhibit vastly different variances, resulting in markedly different topologies.

(@fig-network-contribution). \nThese contributions correspond to the proportion of the network's total trade value that would be lost if a particular country is omitted from the network, *i.e.*, the proportion of total trade value flowing through that country. \nOver the study period, only thirteen countries contributed at least 5% to the network's total trade value once. \nReferring to @fig-countries-profiles, main contributors to the total trade value can be divided into three groups: importers (China, India and Japan); European countries (Germany, Czechia, Austria, Sweden, France, Poland); and traditional wood exporters (Canada, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, and the USA).\n\nAmong importers, Japan's share of total trade value decreased considerably from around 44% in 1996 to less than 6% in 2023. \nOn the other hand, India's contribution increased steadily from around 2% in 1996 to around 16% in 2012, after decreasing to 6% in 2023. \nMost notably, China's share of the total trade value increased sharply, from around 4% in 1996 to more than 56% in 2021, before decreasing to 44% in 2023. \nTogether with results from Figures [-@fig-countries-profiles] and [-@fig-market-concentration], this indicated that around 56% of the total trade value flowed through China in 2021 due to its imports, which is consistent with the high level of market concentration in roundwood imports in over the past decade. The decline in the concentration of roundwood imports since 2021 is likely due to China's decreased trade contribution.\n\nGermany stands out among European countries with a 14% contribution to trade in 2023.\nThe Czech Republic, Austria, Sweden, France, and Poland present similar contributions, between 5% and 8% in 2023. \nWhile France's contribution to trade remained stable at around 4.7% over the study period, other European countries increased their contributions.\nThe contribution of Austria and Sweden moderatly increased from around 4% in 1996 to 8% and 7% in 2023, respectively.\nThe sharpest increases in contributions to trade among European countries are observed for Germany (rising from 6% in 1996 to 14% in 2023), the Czech Republic (rising from 2% in 1996 to 6% in 2023), and Poland (rising from 0% in 1996 to 5% in 2023).\nThese levels of contribution remain relatively low compared to those of main importers such as China.\n\nAmong exporters, the contribution of the USA significantly decreased over the studied period, falling from 33% in 1996 to 13% in 2007. \nIt then stabilized at an average of around 13.7% over the 2007-2023 period. \nCanada's contribution to total trade value increased from 5% in 1996 to 11% in 2002, before decreasing to 6% in 2007. \nIt has remained stable since then, averaging around 6.2%. \nBy contrast, New Zealand's contribution initially slightly fell from 7% in 1996 to 4% in 1998, then stabilised at an average of around 4.4% between 1998 and 2008, before rising significantly to 19% in 2023. \nOn the other hand, Russia exhibits a unique pattern of varying contributions to the total trade value throughout the studied period. \nInitially, Russian contributions increased from 13% in 1996 to 31% in 2007, before dropping sharply to 12% in 2012. \nThis figure then stabilised at an average of around 11.4% between 2012 and 2018, before dropping again to below 1% in 2023. \nThis correlates with findings presented in @fig-countries-profiles, which suggests that Russian trade integration has decreased over time. \nExcept for Russia, which appears to be influenced by short- to medium-term shocks, all contributors to the roundwood trade exhibit long-term variations in their contribution.\n\n# Discussion\n\n<!--Main result: resilient structure, polarization and concentration, and the coming fall of China.-->\nContrary to our expectations, our results suggest that the global roundwood trade network displayed significant resilience to exogenous disruptions. \nPrimarily, we show that the trade network followed its long-term trend toward greater import concentration and polarization around China, rather than experiencing major short-term shifts. \nInterestingly, despite China's substantial growth in market power in recent decades, our findings suggest that its influence on the roundwood trade has declined in recent years, suggesting an impending shift.\n\n<!--Resilient structure: surprisingly, we expected shocks to affect network structure, but overall network dynamics is driven by long-term trends.-->\nCertainly, the network structural metrics showed low to moderate sensitivity to shocks and disruptions. \nThe number of pure exporters, pure importers, and mixed countries, showed slight short-term drops over the studied period (@fig-network-composition). \nShort-term increases and decreases in connectivity or market concentration metrics were also observed from year to year (Figures [-@fig-network-connectivity], [-@fig-market-concentration]). \nThese rises and falls in the network structure likely result from three broad categories of events. \nFirst are economic disruptions, such as financial or banking crises (*e.g.*, the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2016 Chinese financial crisis) and supply chain disruptions (*e.g.*, the Covid-19 pandemic).\nSecond are political events, such as trade disputes [@van_kooten_global_2014; @johnston_impact_2017; @pan_impacts_2021] or bilateral agreements, which affect trade relationships between countries. \nThird are ecological disasters. \nHurricanes, tsunamis, and earthquakes can result in direct and indirect damage, as well as periods of reconstruction that can intensify the need for imports or the ability to export.\nForest fires and storms may affect the availability of roundwood, thereby altering exports and imports throughout the supply and production chains.\nHowever, these shocks seem to have no lasting impact on the network structure, only affecting it in the short term, with a quick recovery the following year.\nThis suggests that the trade network is resilient to exogenous shocks.\n\n<!--Increasing concentration: central role of China, link with Chinese forest policies of the last century, link with urbanization and demand.-->\nIn fact, our results rather show that the roundwood trade network has followed long-term trends over the past decades.\nIn the long term, we found that while the number of countries participating in the roundwood trade network remained relatively stable, it underwent a notable shift in composition, with countries engaging more in both exports and imports (@fig-network-composition), suggesting a better integration of countries in the network and trade intensification.\nIndeed, the network's connectivity tightened at the turn of the 21st century (@fig-network-connectivity), a trend consistent with broader globalization [@prestemon_international_2003].\nOur analysis of network composition and connectivity further reveals an uneven structure: a few highly-connected countries (the hubs) dominate and concentrate trade, while most of the network consists of poorly-connected countries that barely contribute to roundwood trade volumes (Figures [-@fig-countries-profiles], [-@fig-network-connectivity]). \nThese hubs play a critical role in network's functionality [@huang_static_2024] and can wield considerable market power, with potential anti-competitive effects on poorly-connected countries, which constitute the majority of the trade network.\n\nThroughout the study period, many major hubs in the international market, including the USA, Canada, Western Europe, Scandinavia, and Russia, maintained a high number of trading partners.\nHowever, our findings highlight long-term shifts in the trade landscape over recent decades. \nWe observed a decline among traditional core importers and exporters, including Japan, Russia, and the USA, concurrent with the rise of new key players like China and New Zealand (Figures [-@fig-countries-profiles], [-@fig-network-contribution]). \nEspecially, our findings show that China has become *the* central player in the roundwood trade, substantially increasing its number of import and export partners. \nBy 2021, China's imports accounted for 56% of the total roundwood trade value, leading to a highly concentrated and polarized import market (Figures [-@fig-market-concentration], [-@fig-network-contribution]).\nThis confirms findings from other studies [@ke_changes_2019; @long_exploring_2019; @zhou_spatial_2021; @shen_structural_2022; @huang_static_2024].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# Load data\ndir <- dirname(getwd())\npath <- file.path(dir, \"results/network_analysis/intermediary/mirror_flows.csv\")\nmirror <-

show that the roundwood export market is not similarly concentrated (@fig-market-concentration).\nThe relatively low export market concentration levels observed during the last decade are presumably due to Russia's withdrawal from the export market initiated in 2007.\nThe increase in export market concentration at the beginning of the 20th century coincided with Russia's growing contribution to trade (Figures [-@fig-market-concentration], [-@fig-network-contribution]).\nIn 2007, Russian roundwood exports represented 34% of the global roundwood export volumes.\nRussia contribution to roundwood trade then fell from 31% in 2007 to less than 1% in 2023 due to successive export tax increases on roundwood, which preceded a complete export ban in 2022 (@fig-network-contribution) [@lin_incidence_2017; @unecefao_forest_2022; @unecefao_forest_2022-1; @fao_state_2024; @guan_impact_2024].\nRussia's position as the main exporter of roundwood has since been overtaken by New Zealand, which accounted for 20% of total exports in 2023.\nIn 2023, other roundwood exporters significantly contributed to global export volumes: the USA (15% of global roundwood exports), Germany (10%), Czechia (6%), France and Canada (4% each), Poland, Latvia, and Norway (3% each), and Papua New Guinea (2%). \nSuch distribution of export volumes may explain the relatively low concentration levels of the roundwood export market.\n\nIn contrast, our findings suggest that the import market has become highly concentrated primarily due to demand from China (Figures [-@fig-market-concentration], [-@fig-network-contribution]), which, paradoxically, also possesses the fifth-highest forest endowment and presents the first-highest average annual net gain in forest area [@fao_state_2024]. \nIndeed, due to Chinese government efforts in spending, as well as China's market and policy reforms driven by forest conservation demand, China has operated a drastic expansion of its forestry and planted forest extensive margins over the last decades [@demurger_forest_2009; @ke_changes_2019; @zhang_chinas_2019; @zhao_large-scale_2022]. \nHowever, despite an increase in China's forest area and volume, low economic tree planting efficiency and poor forest management have resulted in low stand quality and growth rates [@hoffmann_adapting_2018; @hou_intensifying_2019; @ke_changes_2019; @zhang_chinas_2019]. \nAs a result, domestic timber consumption — primarily for industrial and construction uses — has outpaced domestic production, making China highly dependent on imported wood products, which now account for approximately half of its total timber supply [@demurger_forest_2009; @he_projection_2011; @hoffmann_adapting_2018; @hou_intensifying_2019; @ke_changes_2019].\n\nSuch demand for imported roundwood fosters co-dependence between China and roundwood exporting countries.\nIn fact, China serves as the main trading partner for most major exporters, making them highly reliant on its demand. \nFor instance, in 2020, China imported 46% of roundwood exports from the USA, 67% from Russia, 77% from Congo, 78% from Papua New Guinea, and 86% from New Zealand. \nThe case of New Zealand perfectly illustrates this co-dependence. \nIts rise as a major exporter is closely tied to China's increasing demand and Russia's concurrent withdrawal from the roundwood export market. \nThe share of New Zealand's roundwood exports to China surged from just 1.2% in 1996 to 90.3% in 2023. \nTo mitigate risks from potential disruptions caused by hubs like China or to limit co-dependence, countries can diversify their trade relationships [@huang_static_2024]. \nThe United States appears to have pursued this strategy throughout the study period, as shown in our results (@fig-countries-profiles).\n\nThis overall suggests that roundwood trade flows are predominantly demand-driven rather than supply-pushed. \nIn the case of China, the primary use of wood for industrial and construction uses [@hou_intensifying_2019] echoes the role of population and urbanization in shaping demand for materials [@steinberger_global_2010], which has been identified in the literature [@unecefao_forest_2022-1; @mathieu_meta-analysis_2023; @villamor_preparing_2024]. \nUrbanization, through the growth, maintenance, and operation of buildings, infrastructure, and durable goods, is a major determinant of material consumption [@fernandez_resource_2007; @hu_input_2010; @krausmann_global_2017; @deetman_modelling_2020], which may have a considerable impact on roundwood trade.\nRegions of the world undergoing population increase and urbanization, such as emerging markets in Asia [@deetman_modelling_2020; @unecefao_forest_2022-1], are or are becoming centers of gravity that attract roundwood trade flows, with potential shifts in the role of countries within the trade network.\n\nMost interestingly, China's contribution to the roundwood trade appears to have begun a decline after 2021 (@fig-network-contribution), potentially signaling a new phase in the global roundwood market. \nThree concurrent and reinforcing circomstances may drive this decline: external geopolitical disruptions, domestic self-sufficiency policies, and domestic structural economic changes.\n\nThe initial decline likely stems from major external trade shocks. \nMost notably, Russia’s 2022 roundwood export ban significantly reduced China’s import volumes; in 2021, Russia was China’s third main supplier, accounting for 7.2% of its roundwood imports (a share that fell to 3.2% in 2022). \nConsequently, China appears to be shifting its import strategy from raw logs to processed wood products, absorbing significant volumes of Russian plywood, for example, that were previously destined for Western markets following Ukraine war-related sanctions [@scott_against_2024]. \nThis shock was likely exacerbated by the still ongoing 2018 US-China trade war [@muhammad_end_2021; @pan_impacts_2021]. \nWhile the U.S. share of China’s imports increased from 8.5% in 2021 to 10.9% in 2023 (possibly to compensate for Russian withdrawal from the export market), China’s import volume from the U.S. has dropped by 29% over the same period. \nGiven the current geopolitical climate, a Russian ban lift is unlikely, and escalating U.S.-China trade barriers are expected to cause further significant trade disruptions and diversions in the medium term [@attinasi_navigating_2024; @world_bank_global_2025; @world_trade_organization_global_2025].\n<!-- These may include potential lagged adverse trade effects of the 2020 economic recession and global supply chains disruptions that followed Covid-19 pandemic shock.\nAlthough our results suggest the trade network would likely have recovered from such shock by 2023,[^17] Covid-19 pandemic crisis has hurt consumer confidence in China [@teresiene_impact_2021], hence negatively affecting domestic demand. \n[^17]: Notably through efforts such as the Belt and Road Initiative [@fao_society_2021].\n-->\n\nA second, more policy-driven factor is China’s strategic ambition to enhance self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on wood imports by relying on domestic demand and more comprehensive domestic supply chains [@fao_society_2021; @unecefao_forest_2022-1; @attinasi_navigating_2024]. \nHigh reliance on imports, particularly with sourcing concentration risks intensifying, presents geopolitical risks for China. \nIn this regard, China announced its Plan for the Construction of the National Reserve Forest Project in 2018.\nThis project aims to foster a net increase of 200 million m^3^ per year by 2035 from 20 million newly planted hectares of national reserve forest-an amount designed to cover China’s current total net imports of forest products.\nThis domestic focus aims to make the country less export-oriented and mitigate sourcing risks.\n<!--Yet, New Zealand’s radiata pine plantations are projected to reach maturity and decline in export volumes after 2030.-->\n\nThirdly, China's contribution decline in roundwood trade network may result from demestic economic crisis and structural changes.\nFor the last four years, China has known a real estate crisis which, coupled with slowed productivity growth, ageing population and high debt levels, has significantly slowed its domestic demand for roundwood [@world_bank_global_2025], which again echoes the role of urbanization in fueling demand for materials such as wood.\nFurthermore, while China's position in global value chains has been fueled by labour-intensive industry development [@su_assessment_2020], last-decades increases in labour costs and investments in research and development towards advanced technologies has led China to pivot from consumer goods production and exports to technology-intensive capital production and exports [@fao_society_2021; @attinasi_navigating_2024].\nIn fact, labour-intensive consumer goods production is currently moving out of China, such as Vietnam [@fao_society_2021; @attinasi_navigating_2024].\n\nFinally, the decline may be compounded by domestic economic crises and structural shifts. \nOver the past four years, the real estate crisis in China, coupled with slower productivity growth, an aging population, and high debt levels, has significantly dampened domestic demand for roundwood [@world_bank_global_2025], which again highlights the role of urbanization in driving demand for materials such as wood. \nFurthermore, China is undergoing a structural pivot: driven by rising labor costs and investments in research and development towards advanced technologies, China is shifting from labor-intensive consumer goods production and exports [@su_assessment_2020] to technology-intensive capital production and exports [@fao_society_2021; @attinasi_navigating_2024].[^17]\nThis structural change inherently reduces the domestic manufacturing sector's demand for imported roundwood. \n\n[^17]: In fact, labour-intensive consumer goods production is currently moving out of China, to countries such as Vietnam [@fao_society_2021; @attinasi_navigating_2024].\n\nIn light of these persistent factors, China’s declining integration into the roundwood trade network is likely to continue. \nA potential “post-China” era in the global roundwood market raises crucial concerns: the potential contours of a fragmented trade world marked by policy uncertainty [@attinasi_navigating_2024; @world_trade_organization_global_2025] and the necessity of identifying new, sustainable markets for timber supply for major exporters, such as New Zealand [@villamor_preparing_2024].\n\n<!--Network methodology to analyse trade.-->\nBy considering multiple network metrics, we obtained a clearer picture of the evolution of the network’s structure than using a single metric alone [@shanafelt_-it-yourself_2017; @salau_taking_2022]. \nThe mean number of connections gives us a global measure of network connectivity, but tells nothing of the distribution of connections throughout the network. \nBy measuring variance, skewness, and kurtosis we observed changes in the variation of connections per node, the proportion of poorly to highly-connected nodes, and the scarcity or abundance of countries that diverge from the mean connectivity over time.\nThis provides a thorough diagnosis of the situation of the trade network. \nAs a complement to traditional market concentration indexes, measuring a country’s contribution to traded value provides a detailed overview of each trader’s relative market power. \nIt is crucial to recognize that network analysis should not be viewed as a replacement for traditional methods but rather as a powerful complement. \nIt offers a macro-level, systemic perspective that can inform and enrich the micro-level insights derived from econometric models or the aggregate flow analyses from gravity models. \nSuch multi-methodological approach would allow to leverage the strengths of each technique, leading to a more holistic and robust understanding of complex trade phenomena.\n\n<!--Limitations-->\nHowever, our results show that, despite the powerful explanatory capacity of network analysis, the quality of the underlying trade data is paramount. \nThe validity and interpretability of the results are directly influenced by the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data, as pointed out in the literature [@lovric_social_2018; @wang_exploratory_2020; @zhou_spatial_2021; @huang_static_2024]. \nWhile network analysis partly deals with data discrepancies by simultaneously taking into account exports and imports, it reveals data discrepancies such as inconsistent reporting, missing values, and outliers [@kallio_reliability_2018; @chen_advancing_2022]. \nHence, our results show that China exported roundwood to 32 more countries in 2020 compared to 2000, while simultaneously reporting a decrease of \\$1.2 million in export value on the same period (a decline of about 16%), which seems unlikely (@fig-countries-profiles). \nThis further highlights the caution that should be brought by modelers and data scientists when analysing bilateral trade data, while emphasizes the need for methods to process trade data and correct quality issues or for harmonized and consistent databases [@gaulier_baci_2010; @rougieux_forest_2017].\n\nSimilarly, our results suggest that the country-level perspective is not always the most relevant in trade analysis. \nIn particular, results highlight the singular trade balance of many European countries, which export as much roundwood as they import. \nThis would suggest to rather consider the European Union as a whole, in order to get a clear vision that is not blurred by individual European countries behaviours and that will better reflect the European continent's trade weight and openess.\n\nWhile network analysis captures complexity and describes its organisation, further exploration of the determinants and dynamics is necessary to understand the rules that govern trade organisation, as well as to develop a unified indicator system, as network metrics are diverse.\nMulti-layer networks, in particular, could provide a more comprehensive analysis of global wood product supply chains by linking each wood product network according to value chain logics.\n\n\n<!-- # Conclusion -->\n\n<!-- Overall, our findings reveal that the network's excessive reliance on China is a key feature, as its demand drives trade flows and influences global roundwood resource allocation [@huang_static_2024]. \nChina's market power is significant enough to exacerbate disruption risks for less-connected countries, redirect trade flows in a competitive environment, and create trade co-dependence.\n\n**Declaration of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process** During the preparation of this work the authors used
