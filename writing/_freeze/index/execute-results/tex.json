Redistributing surpluses resulting from overproduction of wood products to countries with demand deficits to address sustainability issues can be achieved through trade. The literature offers a comprehensive study of the international timber trade, but few studies to date consider the physical structure of the trade network in their analyses. We conduct a diagnosis of the international roundwood trade from 1997 to 2017 using a network-theoretic approach, which provides a deeper understanding of the inherent structure of the trade of wood products and complements the existing literature. We expect the global roundwood trade network to be concentrated and to follow global trends in economic growth, but also to be sensitive to major economic and political events and natural disasters. Our results show that the roundwood trade network has increased in value, while varying slightly in size, and has become more interconnected over the study period. We also observed changes in network structure over time that can be explained by three broad categories of events: economic disruptions, political events, and natural disasters. Most importantly, our results show the growing market power of China: in 2017, more than 50% of the network's total trade value was due to Chinese imports, China was among the most connected countries, and countries preferentially traded with China. Lastly, our results have implications for forest policy, as the structure of the network may dictate potential cascades of local or regional shocks to the global trade market, and as the growing polarization around China exacerbates trade tensions in roundwood.\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: mybibfile.bib\nnumbersections: true\nnotebook-links: false\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\n<!--GLOBAL ISSUES-->\n\n<!--General idea-->\n\nInternational wood product trade stands as an increasingly complex and interdependent component of the global economy, intricately tied to environmental concerns, geopolitical shifts, evolving competition schemes, and macroeconomic trends. The uneven global distribution of forest resources, concentrated in a few countries (*e.g.*, Russia, Brazil, Canada, the United States, and China) [@fao2024state], necessitates international trade to balance supply and demand to satisfy domestic consumption [@long_exploring_2019; @huang_static_2024].\n\n<!--Economic expansion: Trade growth dynamics and its drivers-->\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed significant acceleration in international wood product trade, driven by convergent economic and technological determinants. Primary drivers include sustained global economic growth, escalating demand for construction materials fueled by urbanization, trade liberalization, and technological innovations enhancing forestry value chain operational efficiency[^1] [@Prestemon2003; @2021unecefao]. Furthermore, global value chains (GVC) proliferation has restructured production paradigms through the spatial fragmentation of manufacturing processes, leading to new market dynamics and more complex supply chain configurations [@amador2017networks].\n\n[^1]: These innovations encompass advancements in plantation management systems, forest harvesting operations, and manufacturing processes.\n\n<!--Trade potential environmental impact-->\n\nThis trade intensification has precipitated systematic displacement of deforestation pressures, characterized by distinct geographic redistribution patterns. Resource accumulation occurs in nations with predominantly non-indigenous, plantation-based forest systems — typically developed economies with established silviculture infrastructure — while simultaneously exerting extractive pressure on regions where indigenous forest ecosystems face depletion, predominantly within developing nations [@Prestemon2003; @leblois2017has; @pendrill2019deforestation; @abman2020does]. This spatial divergence highlights how trade-mediated demand drives forest degradation. In particular, illegal logging and associated trade represent significant drivers of deforestation and forest degradation globally, exacerbating climate change [@lawson2010illegal].[^2]\n\n[^2]: Illegal logging and its associated trade also extensively contribute to wider environmental damage, such as global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, loss of biodiversity, deprive governments of billions of dollars in vital revenues, foster corruption, undermine the rule of law, and can fuel conflict [@lawson2010illegal].\n\n<!--Ecological consideration: an increase in global environmental consciousness concerning forests-->\n\nThis acceleration of the international wood trade has also coincided with growing environmental consciousness and a rising preference for \"green\" materials with carbon storage capacity, driven by climate change mitigation goals, leading to various environmental regulations and sustainability initiatives [@Prestemon2003]. The emerging forest-based bioeconomy, exemplified by strategies like the European Bioeconomy Strategy, aims to replace non-renewable resources with high-value-added products from woody biomass [@wolfslehner2016forest; @winkel2017towards]. This creates a paradox: while increased wood demand can support decarbonization and sustainable development, unsustainable and illegally sourcing risks exacerbating deforestation and forest degradation. Consequently, market-based tools like forest certification schemes[^3] promote sustainable practices, sometimes restricting wood products trade [@guan2019restricting; @chen2020effect; @boubacar2025sustainable]. Furthermore, timber trade regulations, primarily enforced by developed countries, aim to exclude illegal timber from domestic markets, hindering trade volumes [@moral2020transparency; @rougieux2021impacts; @apeti2023impact; @kim2024analyzing].[^4]\n\n[^3]: Such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).\n\n[^4]: Examples are the European Union’s Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR), the US Lacey Act, the Australia Illegal Logging Prohibition Act, or the Japan Clean Wood Act.\n\n<!--The increasing weight of non-tariff barriers and trade disputes-->\n\nWhile tariff barriers have declined due to international trade agreements, these trade regulations demonstrate that non-tariff barriers (NTBs) increasingly influence wood product trade [@2021unecefao]. NTBs include quotas, embargoes, economic sanctions, export bans, stringent environmental policies, and phytosanitary controls [@li2007potential; @sun2010impacts; @buongiorno2018potential; @2022unecefao; @2024fao]. Notable trade disputes over wood products, such as those between China and the U.S. [@muhammad2021end; @pan2021impacts], Russian roundwood export restrictions [@turner2008implications; @solberg2010forest; @lin2017incidence; @guan2024impact], and the Canada-U.S. softwood lumber dispute [@van2014global; @johnston2017impact], underscore a tension between free trade principles and national policy objectives. Such measures, while often aiming for sustainability or industry protection, can disrupt trade, raise prices, and shift production and consumption patterns.\n\n<!--Trade disruptions faced-->\n\nIn recent years, significant economic and geopolitical disruptions have affected the global supply chain for wood products, leading to volatility in timber prices and shipping costs [@2024fao; @2022unecefao]. The COVID-19 pandemic initially introduced considerable uncertainty into forest product markets but was swiftly followed by a robust economic rebound in 2021, indicating strong underlying demand and inherent resilience [@2022unecefao]. However, the war in Ukraine from mid-2022 exacerbated supply chain disruptions, intensified inflation, and eroded consumer confidence, leading to a demand decline [@2022unecefao] Climate change impact on forests ecosystems worsens such instability, increasing the frequency and severity of natural disturbances like storms, wildfires, and pest outbreaks [@seidl2011unraveling; @seidl2017climate; @curtis2018classifying; @tyukavina2022global; @patacca2023significant], directly disrupting timber supply chains and market stability and deteriorating wood quality [@garcia2025forest]. This apparent vulnerability to external shocks suggests that trade resilience is not absolute but contingent on global economic, environmental, and political stability [@garcia2025forest; @ma2025modelling].\n\n<!--SCIENTIFIC ISSUES-->\n\n<!--A comprehensive study from the literature-->\n\nUnderstanding the intricate web of these relationships and trade flows is paramount for policy formulation and strategic planning. The literature extensively studies the international timber market and trade, spanning from global to subnational scales and various wood products [*e.g.*, @muller2004long; @raunikar2010global; @caurla2013stimulating; @van2014global; @buongiorno2015global; @rougieux2017modelling; @rougieux2021impacts @shen_structural_2022]. These studies employ three primary perspectives: trade mechanism analysis, forecasting, and policy analysis [@buongiorno2016gravity; @riviere2020representations; @mathieu2023meta].\n\n<!--Reliance on models -->\n\nOverall, the literature on international wood trade draws on models. Traditional approaches, primarily forest sector models and econometric models (including gravity models) rooted in economic theory [@buongiorno1996forest; @kallio2004global; @latta2013review; @northway2013forest; @buongiorno2015global], rely on nationally reported data and treat countries as the main unit of analysis, focusing on discrete bilateral trade relationships [@amador2017networks; @shen_structural_2022].\n\n<!--Limits of current practices-->\n\nHowever, these approaches face significant limitations in accounting for multilateral network effects, indirect trade linkages, and cascading interdependencies inherent in modern international trade and contemporary global value chain structures [@de2011world; @amador2017networks; @liu2025spatial]. Consequently, traditional approaches offer limited structural insights and may systematically underestimate critical systemic vulnerabilities such as supply chain fragility, contagion effects, and network resilience, while simultaneously overlooking strategic opportunities revealed by comprehensive network topology analysis [@fevre2006animal; @huang_static_2024]. Furthermore, the existing literature exhibits considerable heterogeneity in analytical frameworks, temporal specifications, and spatial delimitations, hindering systematic meta-analysis and comprehensive understanding of global trade network dynamics.\n\n<!--Network approach-->\n\nWe address this gap by adopting a network theoretic approach that considers the trade flows between countries as the unit of analysis [@de2011world; @amador2017networks]. This perspective offers a deeper, holistic view of wood product trade inherent structure, providing insights into its underlying organization and evolution [@long_exploring_2019; @shen_structural_2022]. Indeed, network analysis has been a powerful tool for studying complex global interactions.[^5]\n\n[^5]: See, for example, [@fevre2006animal], who construct networks of the live animal trade to explain the spread of disease.\n\n<!--Existing network analysis-->\n\nNetwork analysis has significantly advanced the understanding of global wood forest product trade dynamics, moving beyond traditional economic models to reveal structural characteristics, intricate relationships, competitive dynamics, evolutionary trends, network resilience to external shocks, and vulnerabilities [@lovric_social_2018; @long_exploring_2019; @gao_trade_2024; @huang_static_2024]. Previous research indicates these trade networks have significantly evolved and expanded in the 21st century, showing increased complexity and interdependence, broader participation, and enhanced overall trade efficiency and resilience [@wang_exploratory_2020; @gao_trade_2024; @huang_static_2024; @liu_analysis_2024]. While network density remains stable, average trade value has risen [@zhou_spatial_2021].\n\nNetwork analysis has also identified key players and their evolving roles. Historically, North American and European countries were central, but emerging economies like China have become dominant importers and increasingly central players across the supply chain, with their influence growing annually [@zhou_spatial_2021; @gao_trade_2024; @huang_static_2024; @liu_analysis_2024]. Russia and Canada remain major timber exporters, and New Zealand is a significant raw material exporter [@zhou_spatial_2021]. Despite dynamic changes, these networks maintain a relatively stable core-periphery structure, with China and India now prominent in the core [@wang_exploratory_2020]. While core countries boost network resilience, their dominance introduces vulnerabilities [@huang_static_2024].\n\nBeyond structural descriptions, the literature has also investigated factors influencing network evolution, including economic scale, geographical distance, cultural differences, and forest resource endowment [@gao_trade_2024], internal trade effects (reciprocity and transitivity) [@shen_structural_2022], and policy changes [@huang_static_2024].\n\n<!--Going beyond-->\n\nCurrent research on forest product trade networks, while foundational, needs deeper methodological and empirical exploration. Most studies take a broad, macroscopic view, often combining different wood product types, potentially distorting network understanding and leading to less effective trade policies [@gao_trade_2024; @liu_analysis_2024]. A significant gap exists in comprehensively characterizing the structure and temporal evolution of international roundwood trade networks. This gap is critical because roundwood — unprocessed timber directly harvested from forests — represents the primary commodity in global forest product supply chains, directly linked to sustainable forest management and deforestation issues. As the second most traded wood product by volume over the last decade,[^6] roundwood forms the foundational stratum of international forest product trade, linking forest resource extraction with processing industries through complex international trade relationships. The lack of detailed analysis on roundwood trade patterns, both structurally and over time, is a major gap in forest economics research, limiting policy insights for sustainable forest governance.\n\n[^6]: According to FAOSTAT data\n\n<!--What we do to fill the gap-->\n\nThe present work addresses this gap through a comprehensive network analysis of global roundwood trade dynamics spanning the period 1996–2022. First, we conduct a multidimensional network topology analysis using complementary quantitative metrics to systematically characterize roundwood trade network structural properties and their temporal evolution. This employs graph theory-based methodologies alongside traditional trade analysis metrics for comprehensive structural characterization. Second, we use information of past market behaviour to explain changes in network structure. We hypothesise that global roundwood trade networks demonstrate systematic concentration in exports (due to concentrated forest endowments) while exhibiting structural sensitivity to exogenous disruption events, including economic crises, geopolitical instabilities, and natural disasters. This hypothesis framework incorporates three propositions: (1) network concentration in exports remains moderately high over the study period; (2) trade network demonstrates systematic vulnerability to major disruption events; and (3) trade network demonstrates short-term structural recovery patterns following disruption events.\n\n# Material and methods\n\n## Bilateral trade data collection\n\nWe extracted trade data from the UN Comtrade database in Python 3.12.2 using the Python package \"comtradeapicall\" 1.2.1 [@2024comtradeapicall].[^7] The UN Comtrade data provides detailed information on bilateral trade flows by recording the trade reports from almost 200 countries. National statistical reports of trade may be produced on an annual or monthly basis. They cover a wide range of traded commodities, including wood products. Traded commodities are commonly classified under the Harmonized System (HS) nomenclature [@1983hs]. The HS nomenclature encodes each commodity under a 6-digit code, classifying them into chapters (2 digits), headings (4 digits), and subheadings (6 digits). Each trade flow is described through a set of information, including:\n\n[^7]: The Python package \"comtradeapicall\" extracts and downloads UN Comtrade data through API calls.\n\n-   the reporter, *i.e.*, the country that reports the trade flow;\n-   the partner, *i.e.*, the country with which the reporter trades;\n-   the period of reporting, *i.e.*, year of trade and, if reported monthly, month of trade;\n-   the type of trade flow, *i.e.*, import, export, re-import, re-export\n-   the product HS code and description\n-   the trade flow's net weight and traded value (in current US dollars)\n\nSince its creation, the HS nomenclature has been updated approximately every five years. It currently comprises six editions (1996, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2022). Each update to the HS nomenclature may result in changes to commodity codes. For instance, new products may be added, some products may be removed due to, for example, low trade volume, or a product may be specified more precisely and divided into several products.[^8] Although there are corresponding tables between different editions of the HS nomenclature, tracking its evolution is difficult, and changes in product nomenclature can result in gaps in time series.\n\n[^8]: For instance, between the 2007 and the 2012 HS nomenclature editions, the product \"Sawdust and wood waste and scrap, whether or not agglomerated in logs, briquettes, pellets or similar forms\" (code 440130) was subdivided into \"Wood pellets\" (code 440131) and \"Other sawdust and wood waste and scrap, whether or not agglomerated in logs, briquettes, pellets or similar forms\" (code 440139).\n\nFurthermore, although the HS nomenclature provides a common language for trade in all commodities between more than 200 countries, it can lack relevance to industry sectors. Wood products, for example, may be grouped together with bamboo materials or plastic furniture in a single chapter. To ensure consistency, we base our extraction on the sector-specific 2022 FAO Classification of Forest Products [@2022FAOclassif], which provides corresponding tables between the FAO classification and the 2017 and 2022 HS nomenclatures. We extract the corresponding HS product codes for FAO code 012, \"Wood in the rough other than wood fuel\" (hereafter referred to as \"roundwood\"), and we ensure consistency between different HS codes across the successive editions of the HS nomenclature.[^9] The correspondence between FAO product code 012 and HS product codes across successive HS nomenclature editions is provided in supplementary material X. All trade flows are then aggregated by HS product codes, enabling the analysis to focus on roundwood trade flows as defined by the FAO's Classification of Forest Products. This approach ensures the sectorial relevance and continuity of the time series for the analysis.\n\n[^9]: Data were extracted on June 2025.\n\nAs country reports in the UN Comtrade database can be updated or corrected within two years, we collect trade data from 1996 to 2022 to base our analysis on consolidated data. We only extract data on imports and exports. We also remove poorly specified trade flows, *e.g.*, those with a \"non-elsewhere specified\" (NES) partners. Finally, to reduce the noise in the data and remove unrealistic trade flows,[^10] we remove the 5% of trade flows with the lowest net weight or value from the dataset. <!--The complete data acquisition workflow is presented in @fig-data-aquisition-workflow.-->\n\n[^10]: For example, unrealistic trade flows typically correspond to trade flows with a net weight of a few kilograms.\n\n```{=html}\n<!--\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Data acquisition workflow.}\n\\label{fig:data-aquisition-workflow}\n\\end{figure}-->\n```\n\n## Trade network building from bilateral trade data\n\nBased on this data, we define the roundwood trade network for each year by computing edge lists. In network theory, an edge list is a mathematical representation of a network, which is made up of nodes (*e.g.*, countries, individuals, or entities such as banks or websites) and edges or vertices (*e.g.*, the movement of goods or people between countries, physical interactions between people, or the exchange of information or money) [@albert2002statistical; @newman2003structure]. An example of an edge list for a simple network is provided in @fig-edge-list-unweighted. In our case, the edge lists are $N \\times 2$ matrices that correspond to a roundwood trade network with $N$ edges in year $t$. Each edge represents a trade flow (either export or import) between nodes (countries), from the country of origin (*i.e.*, the exporter, indexed $o$), to the country of destination, (*i.e.*, the importer, indexed $d$), in year $t \\in {1996,1998,…,2022}$. The elements of the edge list are nodes that represent countries that engaged in either the export or import of roundwood, in a given year $t$.\n\n![Illustration of an edge list, $E^U$, and its corresponding network graph for an \\textit{unweighted} and \\textit{directed} network of 5 nodes. In the edge list, each row corresponds to an edge from an origin (first column) to a destination (second column). In the network graph, circles indicate nodes and arrows the edges between them.](figures/fig-edge-list-unweighted.png){#fig-edge-list-unweighted width=\"100%\" fig-pos=\"t\"}\n\nWe take the roundwood trade network for each year of the data as a weighted and directed network, *i.e.*, we consider whether or not two countries are connected by trade, the direction of the trade flows, and the \"weight\" (or quantity/value) of the trade flows. In our case, we consider the traded value to be the \"weight\" of the trade flow. This is in contrast to using the net weight in metric tons, which is not an appropriate unit of volume for roundwood as the mass of the roundwood depends on its moisture content.[^11] Due to data discrepancies, the reported trade value from the exporter and importer of the same trade flow may differ for at least two reasons: (1) import reports are expressed as \"cost, insurance and freight\" (CIF), while export reports are expressed as \"free on board\" (FOB), which excludes CIF costs from trade value, leading to bilateral asymmetries; (2) one of the trading partners may not report the trade [@CEPII:2010-23; @rougieux2017forest; @kallio2018reliability; @chen2022advancing; @mitikj2024bridging]. To minimise the bias that such inconsistencies may cause, we consider both the exporter's and importer's reports of trade: $a_{o,d}$ and $a_{d,o}$, respectively. The edge list corresponding to the weighted, directed trade network is now a matrix of size $N \\times 4$.[^12] Each row represents a trade flow for a given year $t$, including the country of origin, the country of destination, and the trade values reported by the exporter and importer, as shown in @fig-edge-list-weighted.[^13] We therefore define 28 edge lists to describe the roundwood trade network for each year of trade.\n\n[^11]: UN Comtrade data provides an alternative \"quantity\" variable (encoded *qty*)to the net weight of the trade flows. However, this variable is poorly reported: (i) units may differ depending on the reporter and range from cubic metres to metres to kilograms, and so on; (ii) the \"quantity\" variable is not recorded in 7.8% of the dataset.\n\n[^12]: In fact, edge lists are close to mirror flows that can be derived from bilateral trade data, such as that provided by the UN Comtrade database.\n\n[^13]: See @rayfield2011connectivity and @thompson2017loss for examples of this approach in ecological networks.\n\n![Illustration of an edge list, $E^W$, and its corresponding network graph for a \\textit{weighted} and \\textit{directed} trade network of 5 nodes. In the edge list, each row corresponds to an edge from an origin (first column) to a destination (second column) and include trade values reported by the country of origin (third column, red) and the country of destination (fourth column, blue). In the network graph, circles indicate nodes and arrows the edges between them.](figures/fig-edge-list-weighted.png){#fig-edge-list-weighted width=\"100%\" fig-pos=\"t\"}\n\n## Trade network properties assessment\n\nEdge lists and any other network objects or raw visualisations are often difficult to read and interpret. Alone, they do not enable a thorough analysis of the structure of a trade network. In order to assess the structural characteristics of trade networks, we computed a series of network metrics for each year, differentiating between exports and imports.[^14] The Python package \"networkx\" 3.4.2 [@SciPyProceedings_11] is used to facilitate the measurement network metrics.\n\n[^14]: Considering directed networks enables analysis from either the origin (exporter) or destination (importer) country perspective, allowing exporter or importer trade behaviour to be inferred.\n\nFirst, we assess the composition of the trade network. For each year, we compute the total number of nodes in the network, *i.e.*, the total number of trading countries. These countries are then divided into three more detailed groups: pure exporters (countries that only export roundwood), pure importers (countries that only import roundwood) and mixed countries (countries that both export and import roundwood). To obtain more detailed information on the composition of the network, we then cross-reference the export and import values of each trading country accounting for at least 1% of to the global export or import value with the number of its export and import trading partners. This provides country trade profiles for each year, allowing trade behaviours and groups to be inferred and their evolution observed over time. This set of metrics provides a general overview of the roundwood trade network.\n\nSecondly, to understand the finer details of the network structure, we then computed a set of metrics that assess the connectivity of the trade network, *i.e.*, the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the number of connections per node [@albert2002statistical; @newman2003structure]. Again, we assess network connectivity differentiating exports and imports. The mean number of connections per node, or node degree, is an average indicator of the degree of connectedness of the network. A high mean number of connections per node means that each country in the network has, on average, a high number of trading partners. The variance of the number of connections per node provides additional information about the dispersion of the number of connections. If the variance is close to zero, then the nodes in the network have more or less the same degree. A high variance indicates that the degree of connectivity of countries largely deviates from the mean. Skewness provides information about the proportion of low to highly connected nodes in the network. If the skewness is negative, the network consists of a higher proportion of highly connected nodes. Conversely, if the skewness is positive, then the network has a higher proportion of lowly connected nodes. Zero skewness implies an equal ratio of low to high connected nodes. Kurtosis provides information on how the degree distribution compares with a normal distribution in terms of its \"tailedness\" or \"flatness\". A positive kurtosis[^15] indicates that tailed outliers are more prevalent than in a normal distribution, meaning countries that diverge from the mean are rare. Conversely, negative kurtosis corresponds to a situation in which outliers are common, *i.e.*, where most countries diverge from the mean.\n\n[^15]: We consider Fisher's definition of kurtosis. A Pearson's definition would have necessitated the comparison of kurtosis values with 3 instead of 0.\n\nLastly, we assess market concentration by combining our network approach with a traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman market concentration index (HHI). The HHI is defined as follows:\n\n$$\nHHI = \\sum^{N}_{i = 1} (MS_{i})^{2}\n$$ {#eq-HHI}\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of countries involved in trade and $MS_{i}$ the market share of the country $i$, that is, the ratio of the value traded by country $i$ to the global value traded. We computed two $HHI$, one for exports and one for imports. The $HHI$ values can range from $1/N$ to 1. According to the $HHI$ value, the US Federal Trade Commission differentiates three types of markets [@doj2010horizontal]:\n\n-   An $HHI$ between 0.01 and 0.15 corresponds to an unconcentrated market, *i.e.*, a market with no anti-competitive effects presumed;\n-   An $HHI$ between 0.15 and 0.25 indicates a moderately concentrated market, *i.e.*, a market with potential or significant anti-competitive effects;\n-   An $HHI$ greater than 0.25 indicates a highly concentrated market, *i.e.*, a market with presumption of anti-competitive effects.\n\nTo obtain a more detailed understanding of market concentration, we calculated each country's annual contribution to the global trade value, *i.e.*, the reduction in total trade value if a given country were removed from the network. This is equivalent to estimating the share of total trade value that \"flows\" through a given country in a particular year. Consequently, the sum of all countries’ contributions does not add up to 100%, due to the bilateral nature of trade flows. This approach allows us to identify dominant countries in the roundwood trade. In cases of high market concentration, the removal of a dominant country is expected to result in a substantial loss in trade value.\n\nCombining multiple complementary metrics offers a more comprehensive understanding of the network’s structure than any single metric alone can provide [@shanafelt2017yourself; @salau2022taking].

On average, 206 countries were involved in roundwood trade from 1996 to 2022. After a moderate increase in the number of countries involved in trade between 1996 and 2008 (an increase of 11.46%, from 192 to 214 countries), the number of countries stabilised until 2015. From 2015 to 2022, the number of trading countries decreased slightly from 214 to 198 (an 8.08% decrease). Aside from these trends, we found short-term slight decreases in the number of trading countries after 2008, 2015, 2019, and 2021, which, as we will discuss later, can likely be attributed to major global events. In addition, we can observe several trends in the share of pure exporters, pure importers, and countries that both export and import roundwood. The number of pure exporters has decreased markedly since 1996, falling from 17 to 7 (a decline of around 59%). In 2022, pure exporters represented only 3% of trading countries compared to an average of 6.2% over the studied period. In contrast, the number of pure importers decreased from 51 to 38 between 1996 and 2007 (a decline of 25%), before rising again to 60 between 2007 and 2015 (an increase of 58%). Since 2015, there has been a moderate decrease to 44 countries (a fall of 27%). In 2022, pure importers represented a larger share (21%) of trading countries than pure exporters (23.2% on average over the study period). Throughout the years, there were consistently more pure importers than pure exporters engaged in the international trade of roundwood, with an average difference of 35 countries. The number of countries that both export and import roundwood (\"mixed countries\") constituted the vast majority of trading countries (70.6% on average over the studied period, 69% in 2022). The number of mixed countries has increased moderately since 1996, rising from 124 to 147 (an increase of around 19%). As for the total number of trading countries, we noticed short terms drops in the number of pure exporters, pure importers, and mixed countries over the studied period. Some drops are common to pure importers and mixed countries (*e.g.*, following 2008 and 2019), while others are group-specific (*e.g.*, following 1997 for pure exporters and 2001 for pure importers).\n\n![Number of trading countries in total and per group: pure exporters (red), pure importers (blue), mixed countries (grey); for each year of trade.](figures/fig-network-composition.png){#fig-network-composition width=\"100%\" fig-pos=\"t\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# Load data\ndir <- dirname(getwd())\npath <- file.path(dir, \"results/network_analysis/output/contributor_profiles.csv\")\nprofiles <- read.csv(file = path, header = TRUE, sep = \";\")\n\n# Filter data for product considered\nprofiles <- profiles %>% filter(cmd == 12)\n\n# Collect information for results\ncompo_tot_2000 <- net_compo[net_compo$period == 2000, ]$tot_nb_nodes\ncontrib_2000 <- profiles[profiles$period == 2000, ]\ncompo_tot_2020 <- net_compo[net_compo$period == 2020, ]$tot_nb_nodes\ncontrib_2020 <- profiles[profiles$period == 2020, ]\n\ncontrib_2020_exp_min <- contrib_2020[contrib_2020$nb_edge_imp == min(contrib_2020$nb_edge_imp), ]\ncontrib_2020_exp_USA <- contrib_2020[contrib_2020$country == 'USA', ]\ncontrib_2020_exp_max_val <- contrib_2020 %>% arrange(desc(primary_value_exp))\n\ncontrib_JAP <- profiles %>%\n  filter(country == \"Japan\", period %in% c(2000, 2020))\ncontrib_JAP_val_2000 <- contrib_JAP[contrib_JAP$period == 2000, ]$primary_value_imp / 1000000\ncontrib_JAP_val_2020 <- contrib_JAP[contrib_JAP$period == 2020, ]$primary_value_imp / 1000000\ndec_val_JAP_2000_2020 <- round(abs((contrib_JAP_val_2020 - contrib_JAP_val_2000) / contrib_JAP_val_2000 * 100))\n\ncontrib_CHN <- profiles %>%\n  filter(country == \"China\", period %in% c(2000, 2020))\ncontrib_CHN_val_2000 <- contrib_CHN[contrib_CHN$period == 2000, ]$primary_value_imp / 1000000000\ncontrib_CHN_val_2020 <- contrib_CHN[contrib_CHN$period == 2020, ]$primary_value_imp / 1000000000\ninc_val_CHN_2000_2020 <- round(abs((contrib_CHN_val_2020 - contrib_CHN_val_2000) / contrib_CHN_val_2000 * 100))\n\ncontrib_CHN_edge_exp_2000 <- contrib_CHN[contrib_CHN$period == 2000, ]$nb_edge_exp\ncontrib_CHN_edge_exp_2020 <- contrib_CHN[contrib_CHN$period == 2020, ]$nb_edge_exp\ninc_edge_exp_CHN_2000_2020 <- round(abs((contrib_CHN_edge_exp_2020 - contrib_CHN_edge_exp_2000) / contrib_CHN_edge_exp_2000 * 100))\n\ncontrib_CHN_val_exp_2000 <- contrib_CHN[contrib_CHN$period == 2000, ]$primary_value_exp\ncontrib_CHN_val_exp_2020 <- contrib_CHN[contrib_CHN$period == 2020, ]$primary_value_exp\ndec_val_CHN_2000_2020 <- round(abs((contrib_CHN_val_exp_2020 - contrib_CHN_val_exp_2000) / contrib_CHN_val_exp_2000 * 100))\n\ncontrib_USA <- profiles %>%\n  filter(country == \"USA\", period %in% c(2000, 2020))\ncontrib_USA_edge_exp_2000 <- contrib_USA[contrib_USA$period == 2000, ]$nb_edge_exp\ncontrib_USA_edge_exp_2020 <- contrib_USA[contrib_USA$period == 2020, ]$nb_edge_exp\ndec_edge_exp_USA_2000_2020 <- round(abs((contrib_USA_edge_exp_2020 - contrib_USA_edge_exp_2000) / contrib_USA_edge_exp_2000 *100))\ncontrib_USA_edge_imp_2000 <- contrib_USA[contrib_USA$period == 2000, ]$nb_edge_imp\ncontrib_USA_edge_imp_2020 <- contrib_USA[contrib_USA$period == 2020, ]$nb_edge_imp\ndec_edge_imp_USA_2000_2020 <- round(abs((contrib_USA_edge_imp_2020 - contrib_USA_edge_imp_2000) / contrib_USA_edge_imp_2000 *100))\n\ncontrib_RUS <- profiles %>%\n  filter(country == \"Russian Federation\", period %in% c(2000, 2020))\ncontrib_RUS_edge_exp_2000 <- contrib_RUS[contrib_RUS$period == 2000, ]$nb_edge_exp\ncontrib_RUS_edge_exp_2020 <- contrib_RUS[contrib_RUS$period == 2020, ]$nb_edge_exp\ncontrib_RUS_edge_imp_2000 <- contrib_RUS[contrib_RUS$period == 2000, ]$nb_edge_imp\ncontrib_RUS_edge_imp_2020 <- contrib_RUS[contrib_RUS$period == 2020, ]$nb_edge_imp\ndec_edge_exp_RUS_2000_2020 <- round(abs((contrib_RUS_edge_exp_2020 - contrib_RUS_edge_exp_2000) / contrib_RUS_edge_exp_2000 *100))\ndec_edge_imp_RUS_2000_2020 <- round(abs((contrib_RUS_edge_imp_2020 - contrib_RUS_edge_imp_2000) / contrib_RUS_edge_imp_2000 *100))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhile 200 countries were involved in the global roundwood trade in 2020, only 31 countries (15.5% of the total) contributed to at least 1% of the export or import value (@fig-countries-profiles). This suggests a certain degree of market concentration in the trade of roundwood. These 31 countries showed different behaviours, and we identified roughly three groups. First, Asian countries, namely China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Vietnam, form a group of importers. Importers have a higher trade value for imports than for exports and have diversified their import connections more than their export connections. Second, several countries belong to the group of exporters. Their export value is higher than their import value, they have a higher number of export partners compared to their import partners, but their number of export trading partners varies. While Papua New Guinea only export to a limited number of 13 countries, net exporters such as Australia, New Zealand, Congo, Cameroon, Brazil and the Russian Federation, have moderately diversified their number of export trading partners (between 20 and 45). New Zealand,the USA, and the Russian Federation stand out as the world's three largest suppliers of roundwood. In particular, the USA shows a unique export pattern with a high diversification of its export trading partners (95 export connections). Finally, we can draw a third group of countries that tend to export as much as they import in trade value, with a balanced number of exporting and importing partners. This group is mainly made up of European countries but also includes countries such as Canada and Malaysia.\n\nThe trade situation has changed significantly between 2000 and 2020 (@fig-countries-profiles). In 20 years, China has overtaken Japan as the main importer of roundwood. Japan's import value decreased dramatically from more than \\$2.33 billion in 2000 to about \\$562 million in 2020, a decrease of 76%. On the other hand, China's import value increased considerably from more than \\$1.654 billion in 2000 to more than \\$8.376 billion in 2020, an increase of about 406%. Surprisingly, the number of China's export trading partners increased sharply by about 133% between 2000 and 2020 (32 new export trading partners), while the value of Chinese export trade decreased by more than \\$1.2 million on the same period (a decline of about 16%), which seems unlikely. In terms of trade value, New Zealand has emerged as the world's top exporter of roundwood, while maintaining a relatively stable number of trading partners. Although the USA and the Russian Federation remained major exporters of roundwood, they appeared to be less integrated into global roundwood trade. Between 2000 and 2020, the USA has lost a large share of its trading partners to import (a fall of 42%), while slightly reducing its export diversification (a fall of only 8%). Similarly, the Russian Federation lost 14 export trading partners (25%) and 6 import trading partners (46%) in the same period.\n\n![Bubble graph showing the profiles of trading countries in 2020 (top) and in 2000 (bottom).

Three general observations can be made regarding the average number of connections per country over time. Firstly, both exporters and importers of roundwood observed an increase in their mean connectivity during the first half of the study period (from 1996 to 2008). During this period, mean connectivity of exporters increased by 25% for exporters (from 12.4 to 15.4 connections per exporter), while that of importers increased by 30% (from 10 to 12.9 connections per importer). The average number of connections per country then stabilised for exporters. Conversely, mean connectivity of importers decreased by 9% (from 12.9 to 11.7 connections per importer) from 2008 to 2016 and has since stabilised. Secondly, exporters were, on average, 22% more connected than importers throughout the study period (14.3 connections per exporter versus 11.7 connections per importer). The gap widened between the first and second halves of the study period (17% between 1996 and 2008, 27% between 2008 and 2022). Thirdly, aside from general trends, short-term increases and decreases in mean connectivity were observed from year to year, with some shared by both by exporters and importers. For example, mean connectivity of both exporters and importers dropped in the years following 2008, 2016, and 2019.\n\nThe variance in the number of connections per node provides additional information on how the connectivity of each country diverges from the overall average. Overall, we observe higher variance in connectivity per country for exporters and importers. Exporters and importers comprise countries with a wide range of trading partners, some of which have a significantly lower number of connections than average (poorly connected countries), while others have a significantly higher number of connections than average (highly connected countries). Variance in the connectivity per country increased for importers from 1996 to 2003 and for exporters until 2010, before decreasing until 2022. Between 1996 and 2005, variance in connectivity per country was, on average, higher for importers than for exporters. This suggests that, during this time period, importers showed greater spread in connectivity compared to the mean. After 2005, exporters and importers displayed similar variances in connectivity. Similar short-term increases and decreases to those observed in mean connectivity per node were seen in the variance from year to year.\n\nSkewness provides information about the distribution of highly and poorly connected nodes within a network. Skewness in connections per country is always positive for both exporters and importers, indicating a greater proportion of countries with low to high connectivity. It remained stable on average for both exporters and importers between 1996 and 2005, followed by an increase until 2010 for exporters and until 2013 for importers. Until 2010, the degree of skewness in connectivity was similar for exporters and importers. Since 2010, the skewness in connectivity has become, on average, higher for importers than for exporters, has slightly increased for importers and has decreased moderately for exporters. That is, there was a greater proportion of poorly connected countries among importers than among exporters, which supports and complements our findings regarding the mean number of connections.\n\nKurtosis indicates whether countries diverge from the mean connectivity in a scarce or abundant manner. During the study period, kurtosis of connections per country remained positive for both exporters and importers. This suggests that countries whose connectivity diverges from the mean connectivity are rarer than those whose connectivity is close to the mean. From 1996 to 2014, skewness of connectivity was higher for exporters than for importers, meaning that exporters diverging from the mean connectivity were, on average, rarer than importers. The reverse was true after 2014. Until 2022, kurtosis of connectivity decreased, while remaining positive. This fall is steeper for exporters than for importers. As with our other network metrics, we observed several short-term fluctuations in skewness and kurtosis over time from year to year, though these were less pronounced.\n\n## Market concentration in roundwood trade over time\n\n![Herfindahl-Hirschman index values over time.

This decline was followed by an increase in the HHI for exporters until 2006, reaching a HHI of 0.15, before falling again until 2011 and reaching a HHI of 0.08. Market of roundwood exports then remained stable and lowly concentrated until 2022, with an average HHI of 0.08 since 2011. In contrast, market concentration of roundwood imports increased sharply, becoming moderately concentrated after 2009 (HHI of 0.17) and highly concentrated after 2013 (HHI of 0.25). After a steep decline from a HHI of 0.26 to 0.18 between 2015 and 2016, market concentration level recovered the following year to reach a HHI of 0.35.

These contributions correspond to the proportion of the network's total trade value that would be lost if a particular country is omitted from the network, *i.e.*, the proportion of total trade value flowing through that country. Over the study period, only ten countries contributed at least 5% to the network's total trade value once. Referring to @fig-countries-profiles, main contributors to the total trade value can be divided into three groups: importers (China, India and Japan); European countries (Germany, Czechia and Austria); and traditional wood exporters (Canada, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, and the USA).\n\nAmong importers, Japan's share of total trade value decreased considerably from around 44% in 1996 to less than 7% in 2022. On the other hand, India's contribution increased steadily from around 2% in 1996 to around 16% in 2012, after decreasing to 5% in 2022. Most notably, China's share of the total trade value increased sharply, from around 4% in 1996 to more than 56% in 2021, before decreasing to 45% in 2022. Together with results from Figures [-@fig-countries-profiles] and [-@fig-market-concentration], this indicated that around 56% of the total trade value flowed through China in 2021 due to its imports, which is consistent with the high level of market concentration in roundwood imports in over the past decade.\n\nAmong European countries, on average, the contribution of Germany and the Czech Republic increased steadily from around 6% and 2% in 1996 to around 14% and 8% in 2022, respectively. In contrast, Austria's contribution rose only slightly from around 4% to 7% over the same period. These levels of contribution remain relatively low compared to those of main importers such as China.\n\nAmong exporters, the contribution of the USA significantly decreased over the studied period, falling from 33% in 1996 to 13% in 2007. It then stabilized at an average of around 13.7% over the 2007-2022 period. Canada's contribution to total trade value increased from 5% in 1996 to 11% in 2002, before decreasing to 6% in 2007. It has remained stable since then, averaging around 6.2%. By contrast, New Zealand's contribution initially slightly fell from 7% in 1996 to 4% in 1998, then stabilised at an average of around 4.4% between 1998 and 2008, before rising significantly to 18% in 2022. On the other hand, Russia exhibits a unique pattern of varying contributions to the total trade value throughout the studied period. Initially, Russian contributions increased from 13% in 1996 to 31% in 2007, before dropping sharply to 12% in 2012. This figure then stabilised at an average of around 11.4% between 2012 and 2018, before dropping again to below 1% in 2022. This correlates with findings presented in @fig-countries-profiles, which suggests that Russian trade integration has decreased over time. Except for Russia, which appears to be influenced by short-term shocks, all contributors to the roundwood trade exhibit long-term variations in their contribution.\n\n# Discussion\n\n<!--Main result: increasing concentration and resilient structure.-->\n\nContrary to our expectations, the global roundwood trade network demonstrated significant resilience to exogenous disruptions. Rather than major short-term shifts, the network continued its long-term trend toward a greater concentration and polarization around China, whose market power has grown substantially in recent decades.\n\n<!--Increasing concentration: central role of China, link with Chinese forest policies of the last century, link with urbanization and demand.-->\n\nWe found that while the number of countries participating in the roundwood trade network remained relatively stable, its composition changed significantly, with countries engaging more in both imports and exports (Figures [-@fig-network-composition], [-@fig-countries-profiles]). The network's connectivity tightened at the turn of the 21st century (@fig-network-connectivity), a trend consistent with broader globalization [@Prestemon2003].\n\nOur analysis of network connectivity further revealed a consistent structure: a few highly-connected countries (the hubs) dominate trade, a pattern that sharply diverges from the network's low overall mean connectivity (@fig-network-connectivity). These hubs play a critical role in the network’s functionality [@huang_static_2024], and potentially have huge market power. Many of the major hubs in the international market, such as the USA, Canada, Western Europe, Scandinavia, and Russia, maintained a high number of trading partners throughout the study period.\n\nHowever, our findings also highlight a significant shift in the trade landscape over recent decades. We observed a decline among traditional core importers and exporters, including Japan, Russia, and the USA, concurrent with the rise of new key players like China and New Zealand (Figures [-@fig-countries-profiles], [-@fig-network-contribution]). China, in particular, has become *the* central player in the roundwood trade, substantially increasing its number of import and export partners. By 2021, China's imports accounted for 56% of the total roundwood trade value, leading to a highly concentrated and polarized import market (Figures [-@fig-market-concentration], [-@fig-network-contribution]). This confirms findings from other studies [@long_exploring_2019; @zhou_spatial_2021; @shen_structural_2022; @huang_static_2024].\n\nThis could appear as a paradox: despite forest resources being geographically concentrated in a few countries, the roundwood export market is not similarly concentrated. Instead, the import market is highly concentrated, primarily due to demand from China, which paradoxically also possesses the fifth-highest forest endowment and presents the first-highest average annual net gain in forest area [@fao2024state]. Indeed, due to Chinese government efforts in spending, as well as China's market and policy reforms driven by forest conservation demand, China has operated an drastic expansion of its forestry and planted forest extensive margins over the last decades [@demurger2009forest; @zhang2019china; @Zhao_2022]. However, despite an increase in China's forest area and volume, low economic tree planting efficiency and poor forest management have resulted in low stand quality and growth rates [@hoffmann2018adapting; @hou2019intensifying; @zhang2019china]. As a result, domestic timber consumption — primarily for industrial and construction uses — has outpaced domestic production, making China highly dependent on imported wood products, which now account for approximately half of its total timber supply [@demurger2009forest; @he2011projection; @hoffmann2018adapting; @hou2019intensifying].\n\nThis overall suggests that roundwood trade flows are predominantly demand-driven rather than supply-pushed. In the case of China, the primary use of wood for industrial and construction uses [@hou2019intensifying] echoes the role of population and urbanization in shaping demand for materials, which has been identified in the literature [@2021unecefao; @mathieu2023meta; @villamor2024preparing]. Explain a bit more, suggest that this will mechanically attract wood trade flows to regions that are increasing in population and getting urbanised, such as Africa and Asia. Explain that while these regions are (becoming) centers of gravity for wood trade flows, the role of countries may shift. In particular, China seems to initiate a decline in 2022 (@fig-network-contribution) which could announce the beginning of new phase in the development of the international trade of roundwood. Such decline may be relative to the building of more comprehensive domestic supply chains or to structural mutation, such as the ageing of the Chinese population and the industrial crisis.\n\nOur findings reveal that the network's excessive reliance on China is a key feature, as its demand drives trade flows and influences global roundwood resource allocation [@huang_static_2024]. China's market power is significant enough to exacerbate disruption risks for less-connected countries, redirect trade flows in a competitive environment, and foster trade co-dependence. In fact, China serves as the main trading partner for most major exporters, making them highly reliant on its demand. For example, in 2020, China imported 46% of roundwood exports from the USA, 67% from Russia, 77% from Congo, 78% from Papua New Guinea, and 86% from New Zealand. The case of New Zealand perfectly illustrates this co-dependence. Its rise as a major exporter is closely tied to China's increasing demand. The share of New Zealand's roundwood exports to China surged from just 1.2% in 1996 to 89.3% in 2022. This increasing co-dependence raises concerns about a potential \"after-China\" era for these exporters [@villamor2024preparing]: where would their roundwood go if not to China? To mitigate risks from potential disruptions caused by hubs like China or to limit co-dependence, countries can diversify their trade relationships [@huang_static_2024]. The United States appears to have pursued this strategy throughout the study period, as shown in our results (@fig-countries-profiles).\n\n<!--Resilient structure: surprisingly, we expected shocks to affect network structure, but overall network dynamics is driven by long-term trends. Except for Russia: roundwood export ban.-->\n\nWhile we expected the network to exhibit structural sensitivity to exogenous disruption events, we found that the roundwood trade network was rather resilient to such disruptions and has followed long-term trends over the past decades. Certainly, the network structural metrics showed low to moderate sensitivity to shocks and disruptions. The number of pure exporters, pure importers, and mixed countries, showed slight short-term drops over the studied period (Figure 3). Short-term increases and decreases in connectivity metrics were also observed from year to year. Yet, such shocks seems to only impact the network structure on the short-term,\n\n\"From 2002 to 2021, China became a superpower in importing upstream wood forest products, ranking first in import volume \\[...\\] This achievement indicates that China was highly dependent on wood imports and had strong resistance and recovery capabilities to deal with shocks.\"\n\n<!--Network methodology to analyse trade. Europe blurs signals.-->\n\nBy considering multiple network metrics, we obtain a clearer picture of the evolution of the network’s structure than using a single metric alone [@shanafelt2017yourself; @salau2022taking]. The mean number of connections gives us a global measure of network connectivity, but tells nothing of the distribution of connections throughout the network. By measuring variance, skewness, and kurtosis we observed changes in the variation of connections per node, the proportion of poorly to highly-connected nodes, and the scarcity or abundance of countries that diverge from the mean connectivity over time. As a complement to traditional market concentration indexes, measuring a country’s contribution to traded value provides a detailed overview of each trader’s relative market power. It is crucial to recognize that network analysis should not be viewed as a replacement for traditional methods but rather as a powerful complement. It offers a macro-level, systemic perspective that can inform and enrich the micro-level insights derived from econometric models or the aggregate flow analyses from gravity models. Such multi-methodological approach would allow to leverage the strengths of each technique, leading to a more holistic and robust understanding of complex trade phenomena.\n\n<!--Limitations-->\n\nHowever, our results show that, despite the powerful explanatory capacity of network analysis, the quality of the underlying trade data is paramount. The validity and interpretability of the results are directly influenced by the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data, as pointed out in the literature [@lovric_social_2018; @wang_exploratory_2020; @zhou_spatial_2021; @huang_static_2024]. While network analysis partly deals with data discrepancies by simultaneously taking into account exports and imports, it reveals data discrepancies such as inconsistent reporting, missing values, and outliers [@kallio2018reliability; @chen2022advancing]. Hence, our results showed that China exported to 32 more countries in 2020 compared to 2000, while simultaneously reporting a decrease of \\$1.2 million in export value on the same period (a decline of about 16%), which seems unlikely (@fig-countries-profiles). This further highlights the caution that should be brought by modelers and data scientists when analysing bilateral trade data, while emphasizes the need for methods to process trade data and correct quality issues or for harmonized and consistent data [@CEPII:2010-23; rougieux2017forest].\n\nSimilarly, our results suggest that the country-level perspective is not always the most relevant in trade analysis. In particular, results highlight the singular trade balance of many European countries, which export as much roundwood as they import. This would suggest to rather consider the European Union as a whole, in order to get a clear vision that is not blurred by individual European countries behaviours and that will better reflect the trade weight of the European continent.\n\nNetwork analysis capture complexity and describe its organisation but further exploration of the determinants and dynamics are necessary to understand what rule complexity organisation. \"To comprehensively analyze the resilience of the global wood and forest products trade network, future research is required to refine and improve the construction of indicator systems.\"\n\n```{=html}\n<!--For example, our results diverge from the conclusion of Zhou et al. (2021) concerning Japan. While Zhou et al. (2021) showed that Japan’s trade in forest products remained relatively constant from 2000 to 2019 , we observed a net decrease in the number of Japanese trading partners from 59 to 33.\n-->\n```\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \nThis implies that trade policy should not solely aim for efficiency through specialization but must also prioritize robustness and diversification of supply channels to mitigate the cascading effects of disruptions, thereby moving beyond simple trade volume maximization towards prioritizing structural stability and risk management within global supply chains.\n-->\n```\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**Declaration of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process** During the preparation of this work the author(s) used \\[NAME TOOL / SERVICE\\] in order to \\[REASON\\].
