      <meta name="citation_title" content="Resilient structure and increasing concentration of the roundwood trade: a network analysis perspective">
<meta name="citation_abstract" content="[TO EDIT] While the use of wood products is increasingly linked to sustainability and climate change issues, forest resources are unevenly distributed among countries and have different regional forest dynamics. Redistributing surpluses resulting from overproduction of wood products to countries with demand deficits to address sustainability issues can be achieved through trade. The literature offers a comprehensive study of the international timber trade, but few studies to date consider the physical structure of the trade network in their analyses. We conduct a diagnosis of the international roundwood trade from 1997 to 2017 using a network-theoretic approach, which provides a deeper understanding of the inherent structure of the trade of wood products and complements the existing literature. We expect the global roundwood trade network to be concentrated and to follow global trends in economic growth, but also to be sensitive to major economic and political events and natural disasters. Our results show that the roundwood trade network has increased in value, while varying slightly in size, and has become more interconnected over the study period. We also observed changes in network structure over time that can be explained by three broad categories of events: economic disruptions, political events, and natural disasters. Most importantly, our results show the growing market power of China: in 2017, more than 50% of the network&amp;amp;#039;s total trade value was due to Chinese imports, China was among the most connected countries, and countries preferentially traded with China. Lastly, our results have implications for forest policy, as the structure of the network may dictate potential cascades of local or regional shocks to the global trade market, and as the growing polarization around China exacerbates trade tensions in roundwood.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does Free Trade Increase Deforestation? The Effects of Regional Trade Agreements;,citation_abstract=This paper provides new, global evidence on the relationship between trade liberalization and deforestation. Using event studies around the enactment of regional trade agreements (RTAs) on a panel of 189 countries from 2001 to 2012, we find a large and statistically significant increase in deforestation over the 3 years following the enactment of an RTA, which coincides with an increase in agricultural land conversion. The findings are robust to a variety of controls and fixed effects. The results on deforestation and agricultural land expansion are driven by developing countries in the tropics, suggesting that trade liberalization not only increases net deforestation but may also shift deforestation into ecologically sensitive locations. We find no evidence that these effects are driven by increases in timber harvest. Our results suggest that trade liberalization efforts should be accompanied by policies to direct agricultural land expansion away from forests and sensitive habitat regions.;,citation_author=Ryan Abman;,citation_author=Clark Lundberg;,citation_publication_date=2020-01;,citation_cover_date=2020-01;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/705787;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1086/705787;,citation_issn=2333-5955;,citation_volume=7;,citation_journal_title=Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Networks of Value‐added Trade;,citation_abstract=Abstract Global value chains (GVCs) require new methods for evaluating interconnections among countries, which can no longer be accurately appraised by standard bilateral gross trade flows. This paper uses tools of network analysis to examine the evolution of value‐added trade from 1995 to 2011. GVCs are very centralised and asymmetric networks, with a few large economies acting as hubs, which exposes them to the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks. As GVCs expanded, the networks of foreign value added in exports became denser, more complex and intensively connected. The regional dimension of GVCs is still dominant but is progressively giving place to a more global network. Networks of foreign value added in goods exports outpace those of services exports. However, foreign inputs of services are important for exports of both goods and services. There is a striking rise of China as a supplier of value added, while Germany and the United States maintain a central role in GVCs over the whole period.;,citation_author=João Amador;,citation_author=Sónia Cabral;,citation_publication_date=2017-07;,citation_cover_date=2017-07;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/twec.12469;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1111/twec.12469;,citation_issn=0378-5920, 1467-9701;,citation_volume=40;,citation_journal_title=The World Economy;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The impact of timber regulations on timber and timber product trade;,citation_abstract=To promote legal imports of timber and timber products, some countries, such as the United States, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and members of the European Union (EU), have adopted timber trade regulations. The implementation of these regulations is the result of the increase in illegal logging and its negative impact on the environment, biodiversity, and climate change. These regulations play an important role in international trade and are part of an effort to combat illegal logging and its consequences, such as deforestation. This study analyzes the impact of the implementation of these regulations on imports of timber and timber products from timber-producing and timber-processing countries with a significant share of illegal logging over the period 1995–2019. To do so, we use a method combining the gravity approach with a matching technique such as entropy balancing. To test the robustness of our results, we estimate alternative specifications and use alternative methods such as the gravity model and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). We find that the implementation of these regulations has a negative effect on imports of timber and timber products. This reduction in imports is mainly more significant for timber and timber products such as pulp and wood furniture and can also vary according to the country implementing the regulation..;,citation_author=Ablam Estel Apeti;,citation_author=Bossoma Doriane N’Doua;,citation_publication_date=2023-11;,citation_cover_date=2023-11;,citation_year=2023;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921800923002069;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2023.107943;,citation_issn=09218009;,citation_volume=213;,citation_journal_title=Ecological Economics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sustainable forest management through certification and wood products trade: Analyzing the role of the FSC across diverse economic and climatic contexts;,citation_abstract=This study investigates the role of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification in advancing sustainable forest management and influencing forest cover changes across 70 countries from 2000 to 2021. Using dynamic panel data model and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimations, the analysis addresses endogeneity concerns, such as those stemming from lagged dependent variables, providing robust and unbiased estimates. Results indicate that FSC certification significantly enhances forest cover, with the most pronounced effects observed in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, the study explores how FSC certification interacts with income levels and climatic conditions, revealing region-specific variations in its effects. These findings highlight the importance of market-based conservation tools, such as FSC certification, which align economic incentives with sustainability objectives. The analysis provides practical insights, recommending the integration of FSC certification into responsible trade practices and the development of regionally tailored forest management strategies to maximize conservation outcomes.;,citation_author=Inoussa Boubacar;,citation_author=Yaya Sissoko;,citation_publication_date=2025-08;,citation_cover_date=2025-08;,citation_year=2025;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652625011369;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.145786;,citation_issn=09596526;,citation_volume=518;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Cleaner Production;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Not just for programmers: How GitHub can accelerate collaborative and reproducible research in ecology and evolution;,citation_abstract=Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology are increasingly dependent on computational code to conduct research. Hence, the use of efficient methods to share, reproduce, and collaborate on code as well as document research is fundamental. GitHub is an online, cloud-based service that can help researchers track, organize, discuss, share, and collaborate on software and other materials related to research production, including data, code for analyses, and protocols. Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub in ecology and evolution is not widespread. To help researchers in ecology and evolution adopt useful features from GitHub to improve their research workflows, we review 12 practical ways to use the platform. We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty, including storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, writing a manuscript, and using automated and continuous integration to streamline analyses. Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration. As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists establish their workflows using GitHub, the field can continue to push the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.;,citation_author=Pedro Henrique Pereira Braga;,citation_author=Katherine Hébert;,citation_author=Emma J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Forest sector modeling: A synthesis of econometrics, mathematical programming, and system dynamics methods;,citation_abstract=Quantitative analysis and forecasting of forest product markets began in the 1950s, based almost exclusively on pure time-series analysis. Since then, considerable improvements have been made in the theoretical basis of the models, the statistical methods of estimation, and the coverage of the data. Especially noteworthy is the exploitation of panel data in the analysis of demand for final products. To model the industry supply of intermediate and final products, however, activity analysis seems more promising than econometrics. It allows for a detailed description of the techniques of production, and, therefore, a better modeling of technical change than the econometric approach. This paper presents a class of models, currently used for policy analysis and forecasting, that present a blend of econometric and mathematical programming, with a dash of system dynamics. Econometrically estimated demand and supply functions are combined with activity analysis of production and transportation, into optimizers to calculate spatial equilibria in multi-product markets. The shadow prices of the optimization are then the key inputs in predicting capacity change by region and process, in system dynamics fashion, and based on Tobin’s q theory of investments.;,citation_author=Joseph Buongiorno;,citation_publication_date=1996-09;,citation_cover_date=1996-09;,citation_year=1996;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0169207096006681;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/0169-2070(96)00668-1;,citation_issn=01692070;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Forecasting;">

The parameters were estimated with a large database by ordinary least squares, fixed-effects and random-effects methods. For the three commodity groups, the results were stable across methods. For HS44, exports were inelastic (0.33 ± 0.19) with respect to the gross domestic product (GDP) of exporters and elastic (1.95 ± 0.15) with the GDP of importers. For HS47, exports were elastic with respect to the exporters GDP (1.67 ± 0.55) and importers GDP (1.10 ± 0.36). Exports of HS48 were inelastic with the exporters GDP (0.81 ± 0.21) and elastic with respect to the importers (1.00 ± 0.14). For all three products, there were marked decreases in exports in 2009 and 2012 independent of GDP. The estimated elasticities were used to predict the growth rate of trade flows from 2015 to 2020 based on exogenous GDP projections of the International Monetary Fund.

To that end, a global forest products model was used to compare the current state of the world, first with a world without imports in the United States, and then without US imports or exports. With prohibitive US protection and no foreign response, the welfare of US producers increased, but by less than the losses of US consumers, while in the rest of the world the producers lost more than the consumers gained. With countervailing measures abroad against US exports, the welfare of US consumers increased, but by less than what US producers lost, and in the rest of the world the consumers’ welfare decreased more than was gained by producers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of Forest Certification on International Trade in Forest Products;,citation_abstract=Forest certification plays an important role in the global trade of legal, sustainably harvested timber. There is no accurate definition of how international forest certification systems impact international trade from a global perspective. This paper is intended to evaluate the influence of forest certification on international trade, so that it can provide a scientific basis for the improvement of the international forest certification systems and for the development of relevant forestry industries in different countries. First, the influence of forest certification on international trade of forest products is explained in the economic model; hence, four hypotheses are put forward. Second, to test these hypotheses, we verify the panel data of bilateral trade and forest certification of all forest products among 67 economies from 2009 to 2018 by incorporating forest certifications into the gravity model. Finally, tests by country groups and product groups were further analyzed, respectively. The results show that: (1) The extended Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) estimation solves the problem of the heteroscedasticity and zero trade value problems of the gravity model well in the forest industry. (2) Forest certification has an export competitive effect, a trade barrier effect, as well as common language effect. (3) Forest certification has asymmetric trade effects. The export competitive effect of forest certification in developing countries is greater than that in developed countries. Forest certification has become a trade barrier for developing countries, especially in the process of trade with developed countries. The common language effect is higher during the trade between developed and developing countries. The export competitive effect of wood products is higher than that of furniture products. Forest certification has trade barrier effect on wood products in developing countries, while it has trade barrier effect on furniture products in developed countries.;,citation_author=Jiaojiao Chen;,citation_author=Lanhui Wang;,citation_author=Lingchao Li;,citation_author=Juliana Magalhães;,citation_author=Weiming Song;,citation_author=Wenming Lu;,citation_author=Lichun Xiong;,citation_author=Wei-Yew Chang;,citation_author=Yujun Sun;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/12/1270;,citation_issue=12;,citation_doi=10.3390/f11121270;,citation_issn=1999-4907;,citation_volume=11;,citation_journal_title=Forests;">

Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.;,citation_author=Philip G. Curtis;,citation_author=Christy M.

These data are essential for monitoring change and innovation in the global wood industry. During these five years, global production and trade of most major wood-based products recorded a decline. Global international trade in wood and paper products reached record levels and then dropped off substantially. Global industrial roundwood removals dropped by 4 percent to 1.92 billion m³ in 2023, while global trade decreased by 13 percent to 100 million m³. Sawnwood production in 2023 decreased in all five regions of the world; global trade in sawnwood declined as well. In 2023, paper production declined in Europe and Northern America, while it stagnated in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. It grew only in the Asia-Pacific region. Global production of graphic papers in 2023 (84 million tonnes) was at its lowest level since 1987. Wood pellet production has increased dramatically in the last decades, mainly owing to demand generated from bioenergy targets set by European countries, the Republic of Korea and Japan.FAO launched new data series on a wide range of products including production and trade in engineered wood products (EWPs); trade quantity and value of sawdust; and trade value in secondary processed wood products (e.g., wooden furniture) and secondary processed paper products (e.g., composite paper and paperboard). As well, FAO contributed to the update or revision of all major forest product classification systems. New data and data on emerging products contribute to the monitoring of raw wood material and wood product flows as well as to value chain analyses that support the development of a forest-based bioeconomy.;,citation_author=undefined FAO;,citation_publication_date=2024;,citation_cover_date=2024;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/cd3650en;,citation_isbn=978-92-5-139445-8;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trade Creation or Diversion?—Evidence from China’s Forest Wood Product Trade;,citation_abstract=In recent years, trade protectionism and unilateralism have prevailed, and countries around the world have imposed restrictions on log exports. It has also become more difficult for China to import wood resources and export deep-processed wood forest products. Based on panel data from 2000 to 2019, this study uses social network analysis to measure the level of the Chinese wood forest product trade network, takes the Chinese free trade agreements (FTAs) as the natural experiment, and uses the multi-stage double-difference method to investigate the impact of the signed FTAs on China’s wood forest product trade. The study finds that the trade network of Chinese wood forest products is becoming increasingly complex, and the central position of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the network is increasing year by year. The signing of FTAs has had a significant positive impact on the trade of wood forest products in China and a significant trade creation effect. This finding remains true after conducting the placebo test and propensity score-matched regression control. At the same time, the import of wood forest products in China will have a significant trade transfer effect due to the signing of FTAs, and this will not affect exports. Although FTAs show significant trade creation and trade transfer effects in China’s wood forest product trade, they also increase, to a certain extent, the mismatch of forest resources worldwide.;,citation_author=Lei Gao;,citation_author=Taowu Pei;,citation_author=Yu Tian;,citation_publication_date=2024-07;,citation_cover_date=2024-07;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/15/7/1276;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.3390/f15071276;,citation_issn=1999-4907;,citation_volume=15;,citation_journal_title=Forests;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Forest value chain resilience from a local perspective in five European countries: Analysis of predictors and co-drivers;,citation_abstract=Climate change-associated disturbances such as storms, wildfires, and pest outbreaks increasingly destabilize forest systems, threatening their ecological, economic, and social functions. These disruptions impact the forest value chain (FVC) by causing fluctuations in timber supply, from a quantity and quality perspective. This study employed the operational resilience framework (ORF) to assess FVC resilience in five European case studies (CZ, HR, DE, FIN, and ESP), focusing on timber supply as a key system variable. A resilience assessment was conducted using resilience thresholds, considering sustainability from both ecological and economic perspectives. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified three predictor groups that influenced FVC resilience: wood production (WP), harvesting systems (HS), and management and silviculture (MS). Findings revealed that regions with proactive management and sufficient processing capacities (CZ, HR, and ESP) maintained relative stability despite natural disturbances, while others (DE and FIN) experienced prolonged instability due to market-driven logging practices and limited adaptive measures. The study highlighted the frequent breaching of resilience thresholds, particularly during high-volume salvage logging following disturbances such as bark beetle outbreaks, windstorms, and wildfires. The results emphasized the importance of integrating adaptive and proactive strategies to mitigate these impacts. The ORF demonstrated potential for operationalizing FVC resilience and provided guidance for improving preparedness against future disturbances.;,citation_author=Sandra P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=BACI: International Trade Database at the Product-Level (the 1994-2007 Version);,citation_abstract=This paper documents the construction of BACI, our international trade database, which covers more than 200 countries and 5,000 products, between 1994 and 2007. New approaches have been developed to reconcile data reported by almost 150 countries to the United Nations Statistics Division, collated via COMTRADE. When both exporting and importing countries report to Comtrade, we have two different figures for the same flow, so it is useful to reconcile these into a single figure. To do this, firstly, as import values are reported CIF (cost, insurance and freight) while exports are reported FOB (free on board), transport and insurance rates have to be estimated and removed from import values. We regress the observed CIF/FOB ratios for a given flow on gravity variables and a product-specific world median unit value. In a second step we evaluate the reliability of countries reporting. We decompose the absolute value of the ratios of mirror flows using a (weighted) variance analysis. These measures of the reliability of reported data are used as weights in the reconciliation of each bilateral trade flow which is reported twice. Taking advantage of this bilateral information on each flow, we end up with a large coverage of countries and more reliable data, especially in terms of unit-values.

This paper examines forest certification costs of companies, and based on this, uses partial equilibrium to analyze its trade restriction effects, and uses space price gradient field model to check whether it is a substitution for tariff barriers. Our conclusion shows that forest certification has restricted the trade of wood products due to its high certified cost, and clarifies that in the case of tariff reduction, trade of wood products are hindered by different levels and different costs of forest certification. This paper implies that efforts should be made to increase the amount of certified forests worldwide. It is necessary to lower the certified cost and important that government policy measures to support certification should include consideration of who bears the cost, support for aggregation of smallholder growers and improved communication in timber supply chains.;,citation_author=Zhijie Guan;,citation_author=Jim Kwee Fat Ip Ping Sheong;,citation_publication_date=2019-11;,citation_cover_date=2019-11;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2019.1607756;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1080/10549811.2019.1607756;,citation_issn=1054-9811;,citation_volume=38;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Sustainable Forestry;">

Nevertheless, despite impressive achievements in forest restoration and conservation efforts, the enhancement of ecosystem services and forest area expansion through plantation development, China was not able to improve its domestic timber supply capacities according to its demands. Consequently, the continually growing wood processing industry is facing a severe demand-and-supply gap, causing high dependencies on timber imports. Outdated forest operations practices, dominated by manual labour, are not able to meet supply demands or to implement new silvicultural strategies for enhancing forest quality and productivity and are a widely unnoted disruption of a sustainable development. Therefore, this review presents the status quo of China’s forest operations sector, how it is shaped by forest policy reforms and recent socio-economic developments.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intensifying Forest Management in China: What does it mean, why, and how?;,citation_abstract=Driven by increased space demand for urbanization and conservation as well as demand for food and bioenergy, competition for forestland in China has intensified. Meanwhile, the forestland in China has been poorly managed, leading to low stand quality, growth rate, and ecosystem functionality. Thus, an overarching question has been how to manage the country’s forestland more efficiently. The objective of this paper is to address this question by assessing China’s forestry development strategy, policy, and practice against the potential of its forests and the goal of its society. Our analysis suggests that a crucial pathway is to implement a classified management strategy, whereby a small portion of suitable forestland is dedicated to intensive plantations for producing timber and fiber, while a selective but large part of the other commercial forests will be more effectively managed to provide ecosystem services as well as to produce timber. Increases in growth and yield from these forests will result in positive feedbacks such that a larger amount of remaining forestland can be devoted to other non-timber uses to achieve sustainability nationally. In addition, a substantial portion of forestland has been and will be further set aside as nature reserves, wildlife habitats, and forest parks, etc. To implement this strategy successfully, China must make transform its forestry organizational and governance systems.;,citation_author=Jianyun Hou;,citation_author=Runsheng Yin;,citation_author=Weiguang Wu;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389934117303118;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2017.10.014;,citation_issn=13899341;,citation_volume=98;,citation_journal_title=Forest Policy and Economics;">

By examining topological features and resilience from 2002 to 2021, this study reveals significant structural evolution and scale expansion in these networks. It finds improvements in network efficiency and resilience, alongside an increase in weighted hierarchy highlighting the prominent roles of core countries like China, the US, and Germany. While these countries bolster network resilience, they also introduce certain vulnerabilities. This study finds notable disassortative mixing without trade volume weights and diversified trends with weights, offering new insights into network dynamics.

The forest product statistics FAOSTAT by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) are perhaps the most widely used data source for such analyses. This study aimed at systematically scrutinizing this important dataset and identifying regions and product categories where improved data on wood and forest industry production and trade would be needed in order to set the modeling and analyses employing these data on a more solid basis. The consistency of the data on production, imports, and export volumes of wood was examined with some simple tests and with the aid of linear programming. The results show that the data related to the supply of wood chips and particles are unreliable in many countries. Improving these data would be important in order to assess the cascading wood input–output flows, to evaluate resource potentials, and to specify more reliable coefficients for wood use in forest sector models. Moreover, the data show remarkable inconsistencies, even of the magnitude of millions of cubic meters, between the apparent supply of wood (harvests + net imports) and forest industry production in many regions. Errors and uncertainties of such magnitude have important consequences on the results of any analysis using the data and call for special attention by the data users.;,citation_author=A. Maarit I.

The analysis uses a difference-in-differences approach based on gravity models, with panel data from over 193 countries that trade tropical timber and sawnwood. The result of the analysis shows that the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR) reduces the trade of illegally harvested timber. It further suggests that the EUTR caused a relatively larger reduction in tropical sawnwood (−0.21%) than that of tropical timber (0.07%). In addition, the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) appeared to cause a significant reduction in tropical sawnwood (−0.07~−0.05%), whereas tropical timber did not appear to have been significantly impacted. In particular, the reduction in timber exports in countries that have signed the VPA, which aims to encourage exports of legally produced timber, has significant implications for both the EU and timber exporters preparing for the VPA, as both parties strive to expand the VPA. The results of this study suggest that the EU needs to make additional efforts to address the decline in exports from countries that signed the VPA.;,citation_author=Dong Hyun Kim;,citation_author=Byeong Il Ahn;,citation_author=Gyuhun Shim;,citation_publication_date=2024-11;,citation_cover_date=2024-11;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/15/11/1879;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.3390/f15111879;,citation_issn=1999-4907;,citation_volume=15;,citation_journal_title=Forests;">

With a ban on roundwood trade, world consumer expenditures for wood products and producer revenues would rise by 2.2 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. World value added would remain unchanged. However, producer revenues would decrease for the main log exporters (16 percent for the Russian Federation, and 10 percent for New Zealand). Value added would decrease most for the main log importers (13 percent in Japan, 7 percent in Korea, and 4 percent in China).

In this paper, we use a Muth-type equilibrium displacement model to investigate the market and welfare impacts of this tax, utilizing a vertical linkage between log and lumber markets and considering factor substitution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that, without considering the vertical linkage, the negative effects of log export tax on equilibrium price for log producers is underestimated when logs and processing services are gross substitutes, and the direction of bias is uncertain when they are gross complements. Empirical simulations show that the burden of Russian log export tax is shared almost equally between foreign log buyers and domestic log producers and that the tax increases domestic lumber production. Further, the marginal effect of the log export tax on domestic lumber production decreases as Russian domestic demand share of logs increases. Overall, the welfare gains for Russian lumber consumers, lumber producers in the form of quasi-rents to processing services, and tax revenue exceed the loss in its logging sector.;,citation_author=Ying Lin;,citation_author=Daowei Zhang;,citation_publication_date=2017-12;,citation_cover_date=2017-12;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/JFE-0360;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jfe.2017.09.003;,citation_issn=11046899;,citation_volume=29;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Forest Economics;">

Therefore, this study used the complex network method, through using kernel density curves every 5 years to show distribution changes of complex network indictors to study the evolution of the trade network of global trade of wood forest products, based on trade data from 1995 to 2020. The results show that the trade relationship between countries is deepening.

The core countries in global wood forest products trade mainly comprise North American and European countries, while several developing countries in Asia with abundant forest and labor endowments are gradually joining the core tier and jointly control the trade market.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Exploring the competitive evolution of global wood forest product trade based on complex network analysis;,citation_abstract=Due to globally uneven distribution of forest resources and timely difference of supply and demand, forest products are difficult to achieve market equilibrium among neighboring countries. The global forest product trade not only alleviates the contradiction of supply and demand, but also ensures the sustainable development of the economic construction for each country. Previous literature analyzed the structure and evolution mechanism of forest product trade from different perspectives, but ignored the competitive relationships among forest product importers. Based on complex network theory, this paper selected global wood forest product trade data from 2004 to 2016. Then we constructed global unweighted and weighted wood-forest-product competitive network from import perspective, and three indicators (density, average path length, and clustering coefficient), core–periphery model and two indicators of competitive intensity were introduced to study the spatial competitive evolution of global wood forest product trade among countries. The results showed that there was wide competition in global wood forest product trade among continents, and the tightness of competitive relationships gradually decreased with time. Secondly, core countries and periphery countries were clearly identified in the competitive network, and China, Japan, the U.S., were the main core countries influencing the evolution of core–periphery structure. Finally, the U.S. played an important role in the global competition system. But with the increment of demand for Asian market, China and other Asian countries gradually became the center of wood-forest-product competition.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A meta-analysis on wood trade flow modeling concepts;,citation_abstract=Papers on forests and forest products often address sustainability and climate change issues. Wood trade flow models study production and exchanges of wood products in order to better understand and analyze these issues. To date, there has not been a complete overview of these models’ objectives, or of the wood trade flow factors they use. We expect wood trade flow models with different objectives to rely on a wide diversity of factors. We performed a meta-analysis on 499 publications about wood trade flow modeling, published between 1972 and 2022 and recorded in the Scopus database. We found that three groups of model objectives constitute most of the literature: understanding trade mechanisms (5% of the literature), forecasting trends (9%), and policy analysis (99%). There is a degree of overlap between these categories, as 14% of the literature uses wood trade flow models for at least two of the latter objectives. Within the category of models exploring or simulating policies, about 37% of papers address major economic disruption issues, 40% concern environmental issues, while 49% relate to energy, welfare or trade policies. Altogether, these models use a narrow set of four categories of factors: price factors (6% of the literature), the interdependency of production factors (11%), policy factors (15%), and stock and trade quantity factors (49%), neglecting other possible factors. This study provides the first comprehensive overview and categorization of the models’ objectives in relation to their factors. Most importantly, the literature rarely uses certain factors that are considered in other commodities or economic sectors. In particular, the central role of urban dynamics in shaping material trade flows remains unexplored overall by wood trade flow modeling.

However, discrepancies in trade reporting, stemming from reasons such as logistics to deliberate misclassification, pose challenges to obtaining an accurate representation of trade activities. This paper provides a systematic examination of these discrepancies by using the Discrepancy Index, a measure of bilateral asymmetry in trade reporting. First, the paper proposes a rich set of country- and product-level indicators that capture both the frequency of misreporting and its impact on the overall recorded trade value. Second, it demonstrates how the Discrepancy Index database can aid analysis and resolve data reliability issues in international trade. This comprehensive data set is used to analyze the general trends in trade data reporting and its reliability, providing empirical insights into the nature and extent of reporting discrepancies. Finally, the paper demonstrates the practical application of the developed discrepancy database and aggregate indicators through case studies of Senegal and the trade relationship between Madagascar and France, shedding light on reporter-specific instances. The paper seeks to equip trade analysts and researchers with tools and resources to make informed decisions on the use of reported trade data and their mirror.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transparency Index of the Supplying Countries’ Institutions and Tree Cover Loss: Determining Factors of EU Timber Imports?;,citation_abstract=Illegal logging and the associated deforestation have serious consequences for biodiversity, the climate, the economy and society. The EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) prohibits the placing of illegally harvested timber or timber products on the market. The objective of this paper is to analyse the recent evolution of EU imports of these products from the international market, in order to check how the transparency index of the supplying countries’ institutions and tree cover loss have influenced this trajectory. To that end, a panel data model is estimated with 228 observations from 38 exporting countries between 2012 and 2017. The results show that EU timber imports have a direct association with the transparency index and an inverse relationship with tree cover loss; both these relationships are highly significant at the one-percent level. Other significant factors are the performance of the EU construction sector (as a proxy for timber demand) and timber supply. In the short and medium-term, Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) signed between the EU and non-EU timber-producing countries have a negative influence on the supply to EU member states. This study presents an analysis of EU timber imports after the implementation of the EUTR, providing specific conclusions that can inform policymakers’ efforts to foster sustainable forest management.;,citation_author=Encarnación Moral-Pajares;,citation_author=Concepción Martínez-Alcalá;,citation_author=Leticia Gallego-Valero;,citation_author=Ángela Andrea Caviedes-Conde;,citation_publication_date=2020-09;,citation_cover_date=2020-09;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/9/1009;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.3390/f11091009;,citation_issn=1999-4907;,citation_volume=11;,citation_journal_title=Forests;">

The goal of this study was to estimate China’s lumber and log import demand and assess how tariffs affect the competitiveness of U.S. products compared to other exporting countries. Using a dynamic framework, we estimated import demand elasticities by exporting country and conducted simulations of China’s new tariff exclusion policy for U.S. products. Results indicated that Chinese importers are highly sensitive to U.S. lumber and log prices, which could explain the significant decline in U.S. exports to China when the retaliatory tariffs were imposed. Projections suggest that tariff elimination should benefit U.S. lumber and log exports to China, primarily at the expense of Russian lumber. However, results indicate that China’s new tariff exclusion policy may not be enough to get U.S. forest products back to pre-trade war levels.;,citation_author=Andrew Muhammad;,citation_author=Keithly G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Forest Sector Partial Equilibrium Models: Processing Components;,citation_abstract=Partial equilibrium models are used extensively in the forest sector to predict the effects of national policies and economic shocks on sector activity, especially trade. Models are made up of four components: supply, demand, processing, and international trade. We focus on the processing component. Processing component costs are commonly represented by an exogenous average per unit cost and the costs of endogenous inputs; the former costs are, in effect, constant marginal costs of production. We provide both a theoretical basis for and illustrate a method to construct a partial equilibrium model that uses variable marginal costs for production and explicitly includes the cost of endogenous inputs. Through a forest sector model, we also evaluate the implications of using constant as opposed to variable marginal costs to represent the processing component. We demonstrate that coherent processing components can be easily included in existing partial equilibrium models and that variable marginal costs in processing components improve model behavior. We conclude that the constant marginal cost components in forest sector models should be universally replaced with a variable marginal cost.;,citation_author=Steven Northway;,citation_author=Gary Q.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impacts of the China-US trade restrictions on the global forest sector: A bilateral trade flow analysis;,citation_abstract=This study assesses the impacts of the China-US trade war on the global forest product markets using the bilateral trade flow module of the Global Forest Products Model. Two alternative scenarios are compared to the businessas-usual situation: (1) the US charges 25% tariff on $200 billion of goods imported from China, which in return imposes differentiated tariffs on $60 billion of goods imported from the US; (2) the US raises the tariff rate from 25% to 30% and China adds extra tariffs on $75 billion of imported goods. It is found that China’s imports of sawnwood and waste paper from the US and the US imports of plywood and other paper from China decreased significantly. Meanwhile, some of the trade flows between China and the US shifted to other parts of the world. Vietnam and New Zealand were the largest winners while Thailand suffered a relatively heavy loss. Product substitution occurred mainly in Asia and Europe, and price changes were within 10%. Overall, China benefited slightly, but the US experienced a loss. These findings have broad policy implications for international trade.;,citation_author=Wenqi Pan;,citation_author=Wei-Yew Chang;,citation_author=Ting Wu;,citation_author=Han Zhang;,citation_author=Zhuo Ning;,citation_author=Hongqiang Yang;,citation_publication_date=2021-02;,citation_cover_date=2021-02;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389934120307012;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2020.102375;,citation_issn=13899341;,citation_volume=123;,citation_journal_title=Forest Policy and Economics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Deforestation displaced: Trade in forest-risk commodities and the prospects for a global forest transition;,citation_abstract=While many developed countries are increasing their forest cover, deforestation is still rife in the tropics and subtropics. With international trade in forest-risk commodities on the rise, it is becoming increasingly important to consider between-country trade linkages in assessing the drivers of—and possible connections between—forest loss and gain across countries. Previous studies have shown that countries that have undergone a forest transition (and are now increasing their forest cover) tend to displace land use outside their borders. However, lack of comprehensive data on deforestation drivers imply that it has not been possible to ascertain whether this has accelerated forest loss in sourcing countries. To remedy this, we present a land-balance model that quantifies deforestation embodied in production of agricultural and forestry commodities at country level across the tropics and subtropics, subsequently tracing embodied deforestation to countries of apparent consumption using a physical, country-to-country trade model. We find that in the period 2005–2013, 62% (5.5 Mha yr−1) of forest loss could be attributed to expanding commercial cropland, pastures and tree plantations. The commodity groups most commonly associated with deforestation were cattle meat, forestry products, oil palm, cereals and soybeans, though variation between countries and regions was large. A large (26%) and slightly increasing share of deforestation was attributed to international demand, the bulk of which (87%) was exported to countries that either exhibit decreasing deforestation rates or increasing forest cover (late- or post-forest transition countries), particularly in Europe and Asia (China, India, and Russia). About a third of the net forest gains in post-forest transition countries was in this way offset by imports of commodities causing deforestation elsewhere, suggesting that achieving a global forest transition will be substantially more challenging than achieving national or regional ones.;,citation_author=Florence Pendrill;,citation_author=U Martin Persson;,citation_author=Javier Godar;,citation_author=Thomas Kastner;,citation_publication_date=2019-05;,citation_cover_date=2019-05;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab0d41;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1088/1748-9326/ab0d41;,citation_issn=1748-9326;,citation_volume=14;,citation_journal_title=Environmental Research Letters;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=International Trade In Forest Products;,citation_abstract=The 21st century continues a trend of rapid growth in both international trade of forest products and a concern for forests. These two trends are connected. Forces causing trade growth are linked to the loss of native forest resources in some countries and the accumulation of nonnative forest resources in other countries. Factors increasing trade include relaxation of trade barriers, income growth, and improvements in wood growing, harvest, and manufacturing technologies.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Representations of the Forest Sector in Economic Models;,citation_abstract=Forest sector models encompass a set of models used for forest-related policy analysis. As representations of a complex human-environment system, they incorporate multiple facts from their target, the forest sector, which is usually understood as comprising forests, forestry and forest industries. Even though they pursue similar goals and display similarities, forest sector models show divergences in their representation of the forest sector. In this paper, we question and discuss the determinants behind the representation of facts in forest sector models, and try to highlight the reasons behind modelling practices. The forest sector’s boundaries are often unclear, and it comprises facts of different natures for which dynamics take place on different time and spatial scales. As a result, modelling practices vary, and both empirical data and theory play varying roles in representing facts. Early models were developed in the 1970s and find their roots in traditional forest economics, the economics of natural resources, econometrics, but also transportation problems and system dynamics. Because they developed within a small but well-connected field, early efforts were influential in shaping current practices. Numerical simulation and scenario analysis are used as means of enquiry into model worlds: in that, forest sector models are a classical example of model use in economics, and they constitute a good example of how simulation models have been developed for decision-support purposes. Forest sector modelling is heavily influenced by its applied uses, and policy contexts shape both questions asked and how facts are introduced in scenario storylines. Understanding the determinants of modelling choices is necessary to ensure sound modelling practices. Forest sector models are now used to address issues wider than timber production. Practices turn to integration into multi-model frameworks to expand the boundaries of the system studied, but also towards the use of qualitative methods as new ways of representing facts, in particular deep changes that quantitative models may not be able to capture.;,citation_author=Miguel Rivière;,citation_author=Sylvain Caurla;,citation_publication_date=2020-09;,citation_cover_date=2020-09;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://journals.openedition.org/oeconomia/9418;,citation_issue=10-3;,citation_doi=10.4000/oeconomia.9418;,citation_issn=2113-5207;,citation_journal_title=Œconomia.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modelling European Forest Products Consumption and Trade in a Context of Structural Change;,citation_abstract=Forests in the European Union grow by 1.2 billion m³ per year. Half of this volume stays in the forest, in particular for sustainable forest management purposes. The other half flows into three industrial sectors: wooden material, paper products and wood energy. These industrial product flows are set into motion and paid for by diverse final consumers. Since 2000, consumption is undergoing important structural changes which cause large disturbances in material, paper and fuel flows. To predict the impact of these changes, economists model relationships between raw material supply, final products demand, prices, production and international trade. This thesis uses panel data econometrics to estimate parameters of empirical models. An introductory chapter sets the policy context of forest resources and forest products of interest at a macroeconomic level. Then I review major forest sector models and I focus on issues encountered while estimating parameters of demand models. A second chapter investigates the potential impact of a trade agreement between the EU and the US on the forest sector. We found that total welfare would increase in the region of the agreement, in addition the agreement benefits more to consumers than to producers. Results show that third party countries are impacted by the agreement too, which highlights the importance of using a global trade model in analysing the impacts of the agreement. In a third chapter I estimate revenue and price elasticities of demand for forest products on a panel of European countries. I deal with non stationarity issues and estimate demand elasticities within cointegrated panels. I demonstrate that revenue elasticities of demand are lower than previous estimates from the literature. Simulations using these robust elasticities in a forest sector model, show a lower demand over a 20 years time horizon. In a fourth chapter, I analyse structural changes in paper products consumption. For this purpose, I use a panel threshold model to estimate the relationship between information technology use and paper products consumption: newsprint, printing and writing paper. I show how paper demand elasticities depend on internet penetration in the population. Thresholds occur once a majority of the population has access to the internet. After the threshold, coefficients between paper consumption and its explanatory variables revenue and price become smaller in absolute terms or even change sign. Based on projections of the number of internet users per country, paper consumption projections could be updated with this type of thresholds models. From a policy perspective, lower demand for graphics paper would free resources and make them available for innovative forest products and services.;,citation_author=Paul Rougieux;,citation_publication_date=2017-03;,citation_cover_date=2017-03;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://theses.hal.science/tel-01546128;,citation_dissertation_institution=Université de Lorraine;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impacts of the FLEGT Action Plan and the EU Timber Regulation on EU Trade in Timber Product;,citation_abstract=The EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) is a key element in the efforts of the European Union to curb the trade in illegal timber products. This study helps to remedy the lack of systematic, statistical analysis of the EUTR’s potential impacts on international trade in timber products. Using cointegration intervention—or shock—models we quantify potential shifts in import prices and quantities of tropical hardwood lumber and oak lumber after the entry into effect of the EUTR. We further estimate import demand models to assess the relation between temperate and tropical hardwood products and whether there was a structural change in demand elasticities after the entry into force of the EUTR. The shock model analysis indicates, for most of the bilateral trade flows where we observe cointegration and a significant shock variable, increasing import prices and decreasing import quantities of tropical hardwood lumber following the EUTR start date, consistent with a contraction of the supply of tropical timber. The results of the import demand models do not give a clear indication as to whether oak lumber is a complementary or substitute product for tropical hardwood lumber, and there are no clear signs of structural changes in demand elasticities. Aside from the analysis, an important contribution of the paper is the procedure for building a long and homogeneous time series of tropical hardwood lumber.;,citation_author=Paul Rougieux;,citation_author=Ragnar Jonsson;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/11/6030;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.3390/su13116030;,citation_issn=2071-1050;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Sustainability;">

There is growing concern about the impact of non-tariff trade measures on the global forest product sector. The objective of this study is to fill a gap and estimate trade and economic impacts of non-tariff barriers and compare them to the impacts of tariffs. Ad-valorem equivalent estimates for a set of well-defined non-tariff trade restrictions are incorporated into a global forest products trade model. Nontariff barriers are found to be less common than tariffs but have similar or bigger aggregate impacts on trade, production, producer revenues, consumer expenditures and value added as tariffs. There is uncertainty in the estimation of ad-valorem equivalence of non-tariff barriers that serves as a caveat on the results. Impacts of reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers are often different across regions and products. While not free from uncertainty, the results underscore the importance of analysing both types of trade policy and the need for continuing comprehensive trade liberalization.;,citation_author=L Sun;,citation_author=B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Implications of the Russian roundwood export tax for the Russian and global wood products sectors;,citation_abstract=Russia is the world’s largest exporter of roundwood, mainly to China, Finland and Japan. The Russian government recently announced an increase in its export tax on softwood roundwood from the present 6.5% of export product value to 80% by January 2009. The effects of this policy on the world forest sector to 2020 were simulated with the Global Forest Products Model. The predicted results were lower Russian roundwood exports and prices, lower global wood supply and higher world roundwood prices. In response, the USA, Germany and New Zealand would increase production and export of roundwood. Major consumers of Russian roundwood would suffer a reduction in production and export of wood products. By 2020 Russian harvests and roundwood exports would be 49 million m3 (19%) and 51 million m3 (50%) lower, respectively. The price of roundwood in Russia would be 16% lower. This would encourage a modest increase in Russian forest product production: 1–3% higher. However, Russian export revenues would be US \3.4 billion (23%) lower as growth in processed exports would fail to offset reduced roundwood export revenue. Value added in all manufacturing sectors would be US \225 million higher in Russia, while it would be US \1.3 billion lower in Finland and US \728 million lower in China.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Global Trends of Forest Loss Due to Fire From 2001 to 2019;,citation_abstract=Forest fires contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and can negatively affect public health, economic activity, and provision of ecosystem services. In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely human-induced and lead to forest degradation. Studies have shown changing fire dynamics across the globe due to both climate and land use change. However, global trends in fire-related forest loss remain uncertain due to the lack of a globally consistent methodology applied to high spatial resolution data. Here, we create the first global 30-m resolution satellite-based map of annual forest loss due to fire. When producing this map, we match the mapped area of forest loss due to fire to the reference area obtained using a sample-based unbiased estimator, thus enabling map-based area reporting and trend analysis. We find an increasing global trend in forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019, driven by near-uniform increases across the tropics, subtropical, and temperate Australia, and boreal Eurasia. The results quantify the increasing threat of fires to remaining forests globally and may improve modeling of future forest fire loss rates under various climate change and development scenarios.;,citation_author=Alexandra Tyukavina;,citation_author=Peter Potapov;,citation_author=Matthew C.

First, we quantitatively present the overall evolution trend of INRTNs by calculating several indicators of network features at the macrolevel. Then, as the intermediate-level characteristics of INRTNs, the core–periphery structures are explored by applying hierarchical clustering and a visual matrix heatmap. Finally, at the microlevel, the imbalance in direction is detected through the combination of node importance in a complex network with bivariate choropleth maps of spatial analysis. The empirical evidence from INRTNs of different product types in this paper will help governments and business administrations to perceive the complex natural resource trade environment, which can instruct policymakers to formulate effective import–export policies and ensure national resource security and sustainable development.;,citation_author=Yujing Wang;,citation_author=Fu Ren;,citation_author=Ruoxin Zhu;,citation_author=Qingyun Du;,citation_publication_date=2020-01;,citation_cover_date=2020-01;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/18/7765;,citation_issue=18;,citation_doi=10.3390/su12187765;,citation_issn=2071-1050;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=Sustainability;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=China’s forest expansion in the last three plus decades: Why and how?;,citation_abstract=China’s forest area and inventory have expanded greatly in the last few decades. In this paper, I explain the reasons and mechanisms for this expansion. Specifically, high demand for timber and environmental services has led to an exponential increase of government spending in forest conservation, afforestation, and reforestation, which are an expansion of extensive margin of planted forests and forestry. Furthermore, market and policy reform have increased the security of forest tenure, and tax reduction and government subsidy have given added incentive for private sectors to invest in forestry. Finally, extra-sectoral factors such as increasing agricultural productivity allow the conversion of some marginal agricultural lands to forestry uses.;,citation_author=Daowei Zhang;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389934118302594;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2018.07.006;,citation_issn=13899341;,citation_volume=98;,citation_journal_title=Forest Policy and Economics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Large-scale forest conservation and restoration programs significantly contributed to land surface greening in China;,citation_abstract=China has implemented a portfolio of large-scale forest conservation and restoration programs (FCRPs) to advance the sustainable management of forests. However, the contributions of these programs to forest recovery and land surface greening were generally evaluated on a local scale, which hindered the systematic planning of FCRPs. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of tree cover (TC) change before and after the intensification of FCRPs using the Mann-Kendall test and the Theil–Sen slope estimator. With the improved phenology-based residual trend analysis (P-RESTREND) method, we derived the spatiotemporal patterns of human-induced tree cover (TCH) change on the national scale. Then, we calculated the effectiveness index of FCRPs at the provincial level, based on which the effectiveness levels for the 31 provinces of mainland China were classified. Our study showed that the area of forested lands with a significant greening trend was almost five times larger in the post-intensification phase (1999–2015) than in the pre-intensification phase of FCRPs (1982–1998). More than 29.9% of the forested lands were significantly improved in TC by human activities in the post-intensification phase. Provinces with high effectiveness levels were generally distributed in humid areas, whereas the majority of provinces with low and moderately low effectiveness levels were spread in arid and semi-arid regions. We concluded that the implementation of FCRPs had contributed greatly to the land surface greening in China. Moreover, the effectiveness of FCRPs in forest recovery was heterogeneous at the provincial level and was driven by multiple natural and socioeconomic factors.;,citation_author=Haiwei Zhao;,citation_author=Chaoyang Wu;,citation_author=Xiaoyue Wang;,citation_publication_date=2022-02;,citation_cover_date=2022-02;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac44c5;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1088/1748-9326/ac44c5;,citation_issn=1748-9326;,citation_volume=17;,citation_journal_title=Environmental Research Letters;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Spatial Correlation and Driving Mechanism of Wood-Based Products Trade Network in RCEP Countries;,citation_abstract=Clarifying the spatial correlation and driving mechanism of wood-based products trade network is conducive to promoting the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to a higher level. Firstly, we explored the characteristics of spatial correlation and evolution tendency of raw material-type wood-based products trade network (TN-WFPM) and product-type wood-based products trade network (TN-WFPP) from the overall characteristics, centrality, and node coreness of the networks according to social network analysis method. Then we analyzed the driving mechanism of the spatial correlation according to the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP). The results show that, compared with TN-WFPM, the density, reciprocity, and agglomeration of the TN-WFPP are relatively stronger. The centrality and evolution characteristics of RCEP countries are different in the networks. The coreness of China and Thailand in the TN-WFPP has always been in the top two, while the coreness of China, Japan, and Korea has increased significantly and China has been the top since 2010 in the TN-WFPM. Factors like cultural distance, forest resource endowment, forest certification area, economic scale, economic distance, and free trade agreements (FTA) have significant impacts on the spatial correlation of wood-based products trade among RCEP countries. Furthermore, the impacts of different factors on the two kinds of networks are heterogeneous.;,citation_author=Yingying Zhou;,citation_author=Yunpei Hong;,citation_author=Baodong Cheng;,citation_author=Lichun Xiong;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/18/10063;,citation_issue=18;,citation_doi=10.3390/su131810063;,citation_issn=2071-1050;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Sustainability;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The World Trade Network;,citation_abstract=This study uses the tools of network analysis to graphically and analytically represent the characteristics of world trade. The structure of the World Trade Network is compared over time, detecting and interpreting patterns of trade ties among countries. The results show that the trading system has become more intensely interconnected, and trade integration at the world level has been increasing, but it is still far from being complete, with the exception of a few areas. At the same time, we observed a strong and increasing heterogeneity in countries’ choice of trade partners, with countries holding very different positions within the network, so that it is very difficult to talk of a representative country in the international trade system. Network indices were also used in a gravity model regression, adding to the explanatory power of the model. Furthermore, the analysis shows that trade policies do play a role in shaping the trade network, and that WTO members are more closely connected than the rest of the world. The structural difference between the extensive and the intensive margin of trade is also highlighted. An important feature of these results is that they pertain to the trading system as a whole, giving a unified view of the system characteristics and complexity.;,citation_author=Luca De Benedictis;,citation_author=Lucia Tajoli;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01360.x;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01360.x;,citation_issn=1467-9701;,citation_volume=34;,citation_journal_title=The World Economy;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Significant increase in natural disturbance impacts on European forests since 1950;,citation_abstract=Over the last decades, the natural disturbance is increasingly putting pressure on European forests. Shifts in disturbance regimes may compromise forest functioning and the continuous provisioning of ecosystem services to society, including their climate change mitigation potential. Although forests are central to many European policies, we lack the long-term empirical data needed for thoroughly understanding disturbance dynamics, modeling them, and developing adaptive management strategies. Here, we present a unique database of &amp;amp;amp;gt;170,000 records of ground-based natural disturbance observations in European forests from 1950 to 2019. Reported data confirm a significant increase in forest disturbance in 34 European countries, causing on an average of 43.8 million m3 of disturbed timber volume per year over the 70-year study period. This value is likely a conservative estimate due to under-reporting, especially of small-scale disturbances. We used machine learning techniques for assessing the magnitude of unreported disturbances, which are estimated to be between 8.6 and 18.3 million m3/year. In the last 20 years, disturbances on average accounted for 16% of the mean annual harvest in Europe. Wind was the most important disturbance agent over the study period (46% of total damage), followed by fire (24%) and bark beetles (17%). Bark beetle disturbance doubled its share of the total damage in the last 20 years. Forest disturbances can profoundly impact ecosystem services (e.g., climate change mitigation), affect regional forest resource provisioning and consequently disrupt long-term management planning objectives and timber markets. We conclude that adaptation to changing disturbance regimes must be placed at the core of the European forest management and policy debate. Furthermore, a coherent and homogeneous monitoring system of natural disturbances is urgently needed in Europe, to better observe and respond to the ongoing changes in forest disturbance regimes.;,citation_author=Marco Patacca;,citation_author=Marcus Lindner;,citation_author=Manuel Esteban Lucas-Borja;,citation_author=Thomas Cordonnier;,citation_author=Gal Fidej;,citation_author=Barry Gardiner;,citation_author=Ylva Hauf;,citation_author=Gediminas Jasinevičius;,citation_author=Sophie Labonne;,citation_author=Edgaras Linkevičius;,citation_author=Mats Mahnken;,citation_author=Slobodan Milanovic;,citation_author=Gert-Jan Nabuurs;,citation_author=Thomas A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Connectivity for conservation: A framework to classify network measures;,citation_abstract=Graph theory, network theory, and circuit theory are increasingly being used to quantify multiple aspects of habitat connectivity and protected areas. There has been an explosive proliferation of network (connectivity) measures, resulting in over 60 measures for ecologists to now choose from. Conceptual clarification on the ecological meaning of these network measures and their interrelationships is overdue. We present a framework that categorizes network measures based on the connectivity property that they quantify (i.e., route-specific flux, route redundancy, route vulnerability, and connected habitat area) and the structural level of the habitat network to which they apply. The framework reveals a lack of network measures in the categories of “route-specific flux among neighboring habitat patches” and “route redundancy at the level of network components.” We propose that network motif and path redundancy measures can be developed to fill the gaps in these categories. The value of this framework lies in its ability to inform the selection and application of network measures. Ultimately, it will allow a better comparison among graph, network, and circuit analyses, which will improve the design and management of connected landscapes.;,citation_author=Bronwyn Rayfield;,citation_author=Marie-Josée Fortin;,citation_author=Andrew Fall;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/09-2190.1;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1890/09-2190.1;,citation_issn=1939-9170;,citation_volume=92;,citation_journal_title=Ecology;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Unraveling the drivers of intensifying forest disturbance regimes in Europe;,citation_abstract=Natural disturbances like wildfire, windthrow and insect outbreaks are critical drivers of composition, structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They are strongly climate-sensitive, and are thus likely to be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest structure and composition associated with management activities such as promoting conifers and increasing standing timber volume (i.e. “forest change”) also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here, we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed in the same order of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance damage in Europe’s forests. Climate change was the main driver of the increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe’s forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management.;,citation_author=Rupert Seidl;,citation_author=Mart-Jan Schelhaas;,citation_author=Manfred J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Loss of habitat and connectivity erodes species diversity, ecosystem functioning, and stability in metacommunity networks;,citation_abstract=Habitat loss fragments metacommunities, altering the movement of species between previously connected habitat patches. The consequences of habitat loss for ecosystem functioning depend, in part, on how these changes in connectivity alter the spatial insurance effects of biodiversity. Spatial insurance is the maintenance of biodiversity and stable ecosystem functioning in changing environments that occurs when species are able to move between local habitat patches in order to track conditions to which they are adapted. Spatial insurance requires a combination of species sorting dynamics, which allow species to disperse to habitats where they are productive, and mass effect dynamics, where dispersal allows species to persist in marginal habitats where environmental conditions do not support growth. Here we use a spatially explicit metacommunity model to show that the relative contribution of species sorting and mass effects to spatial insurance changes with the rate of dispersal. We then simulate different sequences of habitat loss by removing habitat patches based on their betweenness centrality (the degree to which a patch serves as a connection between other patches in the metacommunity). We demonstrate that the sequence of habitat loss has a large, non-linear impact on diversity, ecosystem functioning and stability. Spatial insurance is lost because habitat fragmentation impedes species sorting, while promoting mass effects and dispersal limitation. We find that species sorting dynamics, and thus spatial insurance, are most robust to the removal of habitat patches with low betweenness centrality. These findings advance our understanding of how habitat connectivity facilitates the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and may prove useful for the design of habitat networks.;,citation_author=Patrick L.

        <p>[TO EDIT] While the use of wood products is increasingly linked to sustainability and climate change issues, forest resources are unevenly distributed among countries and have different regional forest dynamics. Redistributing surpluses resulting from overproduction of wood products to countries with demand deficits to address sustainability issues can be achieved through trade. The literature offers a comprehensive study of the international timber trade, but few studies to date consider the physical structure of the trade network in their analyses. We conduct a diagnosis of the international roundwood trade from 1997 to 2017 using a network-theoretic approach, which provides a deeper understanding of the inherent structure of the trade of wood products and complements the existing literature. We expect the global roundwood trade network to be concentrated and to follow global trends in economic growth, but also to be sensitive to major economic and political events and natural disasters. Our results show that the roundwood trade network has increased in value, while varying slightly in size, and has become more interconnected over the study period. We also observed changes in network structure over time that can be explained by three broad categories of events: economic disruptions, political events, and natural disasters. Most importantly, our results show the growing market power of China: in 2017, more than 50% of the network’s total trade value was due to Chinese imports, China was among the most connected countries, and countries preferentially traded with China. Lastly, our results have implications for forest policy, as the structure of the network may dictate potential cascades of local or regional shocks to the global trade market, and as the growing polarization around China exacerbates trade tensions in roundwood.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<!--GLOBAL ISSUES-->
<!--General idea-->
<p>International wood product trade stands as an increasingly complex and interdependent component of the global economy, intricately tied to environmental concerns, geopolitical shifts, evolving competition schemes, and macroeconomic trends. The uneven global distribution of forest resources, concentrated in a few countries (<em>e.g.</em>, Russia, Brazil, Canada, the United States, and China) <span class="citation" data-cites="fao_state_2024">(<a href="#ref-fao_state_2024" role="doc-biblioref">FAO 2024b</a>)</span>, necessitates international trade to balance supply and demand to satisfy domestic consumption <span class="citation" data-cites="long_exploring_2019 huang_static_2024">(<a href="#ref-long_exploring_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Long et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<!--Economic expansion: Trade growth dynamics and its drivers-->
<p>The 21st century has witnessed significant acceleration in international wood product trade, driven by convergent economic and technological determinants. Primary drivers include sustained global economic growth, escalating demand for construction materials fueled by urbanization, trade liberalization, and technological innovations enhancing forestry value chain operational efficiency<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="prestemon_international_2003 unecefao_forest_2022-1">(<a href="#ref-prestemon_international_2003" role="doc-biblioref">Prestemon et al. 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-unecefao_forest_2022-1" role="doc-biblioref">UNECE/FAO 2022b</a>)</span>. Furthermore, global value chains (GVC) proliferation has restructured production paradigms through the spatial fragmentation of manufacturing processes, leading to new market dynamics and more complex supply chain configurations <span class="citation" data-cites="amador_networks_2017">(<a href="#ref-amador_networks_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Amador and Cabral 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<!--Trade potential environmental impact-->
<p>This trade intensification has precipitated systematic displacement of deforestation pressures, characterized by distinct geographic redistribution patterns. Resource accumulation occurs in nations with predominantly non-indigenous, plantation-based forest systems — typically developed economies with established silviculture infrastructure — while simultaneously exerting extractive pressure on regions where indigenous forest ecosystems face depletion, predominantly within developing nations <span class="citation" data-cites="prestemon_international_2003 leblois_what_2017 pendrill_deforestation_2019 abman_does_2020">(<a href="#ref-prestemon_international_2003" role="doc-biblioref">Prestemon et al. 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-leblois_what_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Leblois, Damette, and Wolfersberger 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-pendrill_deforestation_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Pendrill et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-abman_does_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Abman and Lundberg 2020</a>)</span>. This spatial divergence highlights how trade-mediated demand drives forest degradation. In particular, illegal logging and associated trade represent significant drivers of deforestation and forest degradation globally, exacerbating climate change <span class="citation" data-cites="lawson_illegal_2010">(<a href="#ref-lawson_illegal_2010" role="doc-biblioref">Lawson and MacFaul 2010</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<!--Ecological consideration: an increase in global environmental consciousness concerning forests-->
<p>This acceleration of the international wood trade has also coincided with growing environmental consciousness and a rising preference for “green” materials with carbon storage capacity, driven by climate change mitigation goals, leading to various environmental regulations and sustainability initiatives <span class="citation" data-cites="prestemon_international_2003">(<a href="#ref-prestemon_international_2003" role="doc-biblioref">Prestemon et al. 2003</a>)</span>. The emerging forest-based bioeconomy, exemplified by strategies like the European Bioeconomy Strategy, aims to replace non-renewable resources with high-value-added products from woody biomass <span class="citation" data-cites="wolfslehner_forest_2016 winkel_towards_2017">(<a href="#ref-wolfslehner_forest_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Wolfslehner et al. 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-winkel_towards_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Winkel and European Forest Institute 2017</a>)</span>. This creates a paradox: while increased wood demand can support decarbonization and sustainable development, unsustainable and illegally sourcing risks exacerbating deforestation and forest degradation. Consequently, market-based tools like forest certification schemes<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> promote sustainable practices, sometimes restricting wood products trade <span class="citation" data-cites="guan_restricting_2019 chen_effect_2020 boubacar_sustainable_2025">(<a href="#ref-guan_restricting_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Guan and Ip Ping Sheong 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-chen_effect_2020" role="doc-biblioref">J. Chen et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-boubacar_sustainable_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Boubacar and Sissoko 2025</a>)</span>. Furthermore, timber trade regulations, primarily enforced by developed countries, aim to exclude illegal timber from domestic markets, hindering trade volumes <span class="citation" data-cites="moral-pajares_transparency_2020 rougieux_impacts_2021 apeti_impact_2023 kim_analyzing_2024">(<a href="#ref-moral-pajares_transparency_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Moral-Pajares et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-rougieux_impacts_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Rougieux and Jonsson 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-apeti_impact_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Apeti and N’Doua 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-kim_analyzing_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Kim, Ahn, and Shim 2024</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<!--The increasing weight of non-tariff barriers and trade disputes-->
<p>While tariff barriers have declined due to international trade agreements, these trade regulations demonstrate that non-tariff barriers (NTBs) increasingly influence wood product trade <span class="citation" data-cites="unecefao_forest_2022-1">(<a href="#ref-unecefao_forest_2022-1" role="doc-biblioref">UNECE/FAO 2022b</a>)</span>. NTBs include quotas, embargoes, economic sanctions, export bans, stringent environmental policies, and phytosanitary controls <span class="citation" data-cites="li_potential_2007 sun_impacts_2010 buongiorno_potential_2018 unecefao_forest_2022 fao_global_2024">(<a href="#ref-li_potential_2007" role="doc-biblioref">Li et al. 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-sun_impacts_2010" role="doc-biblioref">Sun et al. 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-buongiorno_potential_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Joseph Buongiorno and Johnston 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-unecefao_forest_2022" role="doc-biblioref">UNECE/FAO 2022a</a>; <a href="#ref-fao_global_2024" role="doc-biblioref">FAO 2024a</a>)</span>.

Such measures, while often aiming for sustainability or industry protection, can disrupt trade, raise prices, and shift production and consumption patterns.</p>
<!--Trade disruptions faced-->
<p>In recent years, significant economic and geopolitical disruptions have affected the global supply chain for wood products, leading to volatility in timber prices and shipping costs <span class="citation" data-cites="fao_global_2024 unecefao_forest_2022">(<a href="#ref-fao_global_2024" role="doc-biblioref">FAO 2024a</a>; <a href="#ref-unecefao_forest_2022" role="doc-biblioref">UNECE/FAO 2022a</a>)</span>. The COVID-19 pandemic initially introduced considerable uncertainty into forest product markets but was swiftly followed by a robust economic rebound in 2021, indicating strong underlying demand and inherent resilience <span class="citation" data-cites="unecefao_forest_2022">(<a href="#ref-unecefao_forest_2022" role="doc-biblioref">UNECE/FAO 2022a</a>)</span>. However, the war in Ukraine from mid-2022 exacerbated supply chain disruptions, intensified inflation, and eroded consumer confidence, leading to a demand decline <span class="citation" data-cites="unecefao_forest_2022">(<a href="#ref-unecefao_forest_2022" role="doc-biblioref">UNECE/FAO 2022a</a>)</span> Climate change impact on forests ecosystems worsens such instability, increasing the frequency and severity of natural disturbances like storms, wildfires, and pest outbreaks <span class="citation" data-cites="seidl_unraveling_2011 seidl_climate_2017 curtis_classifying_2018 tyukavina_global_2022 patacca_significant_2023">(<a href="#ref-seidl_unraveling_2011" role="doc-biblioref">Seidl, Schelhaas, and Lexer 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-seidl_climate_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Seidl and Rammer 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-curtis_classifying_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Curtis et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-tyukavina_global_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Tyukavina et al. 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-patacca_significant_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Patacca et al. 2023</a>)</span>, directly disrupting timber supply chains and market stability and deteriorating wood quality <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia-jacome_forest_2025">(<a href="#ref-garcia-jacome_forest_2025" role="doc-biblioref">García-Jácome et al. 2025</a>)</span>.

<!--SCIENTIFIC ISSUES-->
<!--A comprehensive study from the literature-->
<p>Understanding the intricate web of these relationships and trade flows is paramount for policy formulation and strategic planning. The literature extensively studies the international timber market and trade, spanning from global to subnational scales and various wood products <span class="citation" data-cites="muller_longterm_2004 raunikar_global_2010 caurla_stimulating_2013 van_kooten_global_2014 buongiorno_global_2015 rougieux_modelling_2017 rougieux_impacts_2021">Shen and Lovrić (<a href="#ref-shen_structural_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. These studies employ three primary perspectives: trade mechanism analysis, forecasting, and policy analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="buongiorno_gravity_2016 riviere_representations_2020 mathieu_meta-analysis_2023">(<a href="#ref-buongiorno_gravity_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Joseph Buongiorno 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-riviere_representations_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Rivière and Caurla 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-mathieu_meta-analysis_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Mathieu and Roda 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<!--Reliance on models -->
<p>Overall, the literature on international wood trade draws on models. Traditional approaches, primarily forest sector models and econometric models (including gravity models) rooted in economic theory <span class="citation" data-cites="buongiorno_forest_1996 kallio_global_2004 latta_review_2013 northway_forest_2013 buongiorno_global_2015">(<a href="#ref-buongiorno_forest_1996" role="doc-biblioref">Joseph Buongiorno 1996</a>; <a href="#ref-kallio_global_2004" role="doc-biblioref">A.

Buongiorno 2015</a>)</span>, rely on nationally reported data and treat countries as the main unit of analysis, focusing on discrete bilateral trade relationships <span class="citation" data-cites="amador_networks_2017 shen_structural_2022">(<a href="#ref-amador_networks_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Amador and Cabral 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-shen_structural_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Shen and Lovrić 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<!--Limits of current practices-->
<p>However, these approaches face significant limitations in accounting for multilateral network effects, indirect trade linkages, and cascading interdependencies inherent in modern international trade and contemporary global value chain structures <span class="citation" data-cites="de_benedictis_world_2011 amador_networks_2017 liu_spatial-temporal_2025">(<a href="#ref-de_benedictis_world_2011" role="doc-biblioref">De Benedictis and Tajoli 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-amador_networks_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Amador and Cabral 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-liu_spatial-temporal_2025" role="doc-biblioref">D. Liu et al. 2025</a>)</span>. Consequently, traditional approaches offer limited structural insights and may systematically underestimate critical systemic vulnerabilities such as supply chain fragility, contagion effects, and network resilience, while simultaneously overlooking strategic opportunities revealed by comprehensive network topology analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="fevre_animal_2006 huang_static_2024">(<a href="#ref-fevre_animal_2006" role="doc-biblioref">Fèvre et al. 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>)</span>. Furthermore, the existing literature exhibits considerable heterogeneity in analytical frameworks, temporal specifications, and spatial delimitations, hindering systematic meta-analysis and comprehensive understanding of global trade network dynamics.</p>
<!--Network approach-->
<p>We address this gap by adopting a network theoretic approach that considers the trade flows between countries as the unit of analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="de_benedictis_world_2011 amador_networks_2017">(<a href="#ref-de_benedictis_world_2011" role="doc-biblioref">De Benedictis and Tajoli 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-amador_networks_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Amador and Cabral 2017</a>)</span>. This perspective offers a deeper, holistic view of wood product trade inherent structure, providing insights into its underlying organization and evolution <span class="citation" data-cites="long_exploring_2019 shen_structural_2022">(<a href="#ref-long_exploring_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Long et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-shen_structural_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Shen and Lovrić 2022</a>)</span>. Indeed, network analysis has been a powerful tool for studying complex global interactions.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<!--Existing network analysis-->
<p>Network analysis has significantly advanced the understanding of global wood forest product trade dynamics, moving beyond traditional economic models to reveal structural characteristics, intricate relationships, competitive dynamics, evolutionary trends, network resilience to external shocks, and vulnerabilities <span class="citation" data-cites="lovric_social_2018 long_exploring_2019 gao_trade_2024 huang_static_2024">(<a href="#ref-lovric_social_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Lovrić et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-long_exploring_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Long et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-gao_trade_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Gao, Pei, and Tian 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>)</span>. Previous research indicates these trade networks have significantly evolved and expanded in the 21st century, showing increased complexity and interdependence, broader participation, and enhanced overall trade efficiency and resilience <span class="citation" data-cites="wang_exploratory_2020 gao_trade_2024 huang_static_2024 liu_analysis_2024">(<a href="#ref-wang_exploratory_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-gao_trade_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Gao, Pei, and Tian 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-liu_analysis_2024" role="doc-biblioref">L.

<p>Network analysis has also identified key players and their evolving roles. Historically, North American and European countries were central, but emerging economies like China have become dominant importers and increasingly central players across the supply chain, with their influence growing annually <span class="citation" data-cites="zhou_spatial_2021 gao_trade_2024 huang_static_2024 liu_analysis_2024">(<a href="#ref-zhou_spatial_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Zhou et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-gao_trade_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Gao, Pei, and Tian 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-liu_analysis_2024" role="doc-biblioref">L.

Despite dynamic changes, these networks maintain a relatively stable core-periphery structure, with China and India now prominent in the core <span class="citation" data-cites="wang_exploratory_2020">(<a href="#ref-wang_exploratory_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al. 2020</a>)</span>.

<p>Beyond structural descriptions, the literature has also investigated factors influencing network evolution, including economic scale, geographical distance, cultural differences, and forest resource endowment <span class="citation" data-cites="gao_trade_2024">(<a href="#ref-gao_trade_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Gao, Pei, and Tian 2024</a>)</span>, internal trade effects (reciprocity and transitivity) <span class="citation" data-cites="shen_structural_2022">(<a href="#ref-shen_structural_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Shen and Lovrić 2022</a>)</span>, and policy changes <span class="citation" data-cites="huang_static_2024">(<a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<!--Going beyond-->
<p>Current research on forest product trade networks, while foundational, needs deeper methodological and empirical exploration. Most studies take a broad, macroscopic view, often combining different wood product types, potentially distorting network understanding and leading to less effective trade policies <span class="citation" data-cites="gao_trade_2024 liu_analysis_2024">(<a href="#ref-gao_trade_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Gao, Pei, and Tian 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-liu_analysis_2024" role="doc-biblioref">L. Liu et al. 2024</a>)</span>. A significant gap exists in comprehensively characterizing the structure and temporal evolution of international roundwood trade networks. This gap is critical because roundwood — unprocessed timber directly harvested from forests — represents the primary commodity in global forest product supply chains, directly linked to sustainable forest management and deforestation issues. As the second most traded wood product by volume over the last decade,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> roundwood forms the foundational stratum of international forest product trade, linking forest resource extraction with processing industries through complex international trade relationships. The lack of detailed analysis on roundwood trade patterns, both structurally and over time, is a major gap in forest economics research, limiting policy insights for sustainable forest governance.</p>
<!--What we do to fill the gap-->
<p>The present work addresses this gap through a comprehensive network analysis of global roundwood trade dynamics spanning the period 1996–2022. First, we conduct a multidimensional network topology analysis using complementary quantitative metrics to systematically characterize roundwood trade network structural properties and their temporal evolution. This employs graph theory-based methodologies alongside traditional trade analysis metrics for comprehensive structural characterization. Second, we use information of past market behaviour to explain changes in network structure. We hypothesise that global roundwood trade networks demonstrate systematic concentration in exports (due to concentrated forest endowments) while exhibiting structural sensitivity to exogenous disruption events, including economic crises, geopolitical instabilities, and natural disasters. This hypothesis framework incorporates three propositions: (1) network concentration in exports remains moderately high over the study period; (2) trade network demonstrates systematic vulnerability to major disruption events; and (3) trade network demonstrates short-term structural recovery patterns following disruption events.</p>

<p>We extracted trade data from the UN Comtrade database in Python 3.12.2 using the Python package “comtradeapicall” 1.2.1 <span class="citation" data-cites="untradestats_comtradeapicall_2024">(<a href="#ref-untradestats_comtradeapicall_2024" role="doc-biblioref">untradestats 2024</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The UN Comtrade data provides detailed information on bilateral trade flows by recording the trade reports from almost 200 countries. National statistical reports of trade may be produced on an annual or monthly basis. They cover a wide range of traded commodities, including wood products. Traded commodities are commonly classified under the Harmonized System (HS) nomenclature <span class="citation" data-cites="world_customs_organization_international_1983">(<a href="#ref-world_customs_organization_international_1983" role="doc-biblioref">World Customs Organization 1983</a>)</span>. The HS nomenclature encodes each commodity under a 6-digit code, classifying them into chapters (2 digits), headings (4 digits), and subheadings (6 digits). Each trade flow is described through a set of information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the reporter, <em>i.e.</em>, the country that reports the trade flow;</li>
<li>the partner, <em>i.e.</em>, the country with which the reporter trades;</li>
<li>the period of reporting, <em>i.e.</em>, year of trade and, if reported monthly, month of trade;</li>
<li>the type of trade flow, <em>i.e.</em>, import, export, re-import, re-export</li>
<li>the product HS code and description</li>
<li>the trade flow’s net weight and traded value (in current US dollars)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its creation, the HS nomenclature has been updated approximately every five years. It currently comprises six editions (1996, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2022). Each update to the HS nomenclature may result in changes to commodity codes. For instance, new products may be added, some products may be removed due to, for example, low trade volume, or a product may be specified more precisely and divided into several products.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Although there are corresponding tables between different editions of the HS nomenclature, tracking its evolution is difficult, and changes in product nomenclature can result in gaps in time series.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the HS nomenclature provides a common language for trade in all commodities between more than 200 countries, it can lack relevance to industry sectors. Wood products, for example, may be grouped together with bamboo materials or plastic furniture in a single chapter. To ensure consistency, we base our extraction on the sector-specific 2022 FAO Classification of Forest Products <span class="citation" data-cites="fao_classification_2022">(<a href="#ref-fao_classification_2022" role="doc-biblioref">FAO 2022</a>)</span>, which provides corresponding tables between the FAO classification and the 2017 and 2022 HS nomenclatures. We extract the corresponding HS product codes for FAO code 012, “Wood in the rough other than wood fuel” (hereafter referred to as “roundwood”), and we ensure consistency between different HS codes across the successive editions of the HS nomenclature.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The correspondence between FAO product code 012 and HS product codes across successive HS nomenclature editions is provided in supplementary material X. All trade flows are then aggregated by HS product codes, enabling the analysis to focus on roundwood trade flows as defined by the FAO’s Classification of Forest Products. This approach ensures the sectorial relevance and continuity of the time series for the analysis.</p>
<p>As country reports in the UN Comtrade database can be updated or corrected within two years, we collect trade data from 1996 to 2022 to base our analysis on consolidated data. We only extract data on imports and exports. We also remove poorly specified trade flows, <em>e.g.</em>, those with a “non-elsewhere specified” (NES) partners. Finally, to reduce the noise in the data and remove unrealistic trade flows,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> we remove the 5% of trade flows with the lowest net weight or value from the dataset. <!--The complete data acquisition workflow is presented in @fig-data-aquisition-workflow.--></p>

<p>Based on this data, we define the roundwood trade network for each year by computing edge lists. In network theory, an edge list is a mathematical representation of a network, which is made up of nodes (<em>e.g.</em>, countries, individuals, or entities such as banks or websites) and edges or vertices (<em>e.g.</em>, the movement of goods or people between countries, physical interactions between people, or the exchange of information or money) <span class="citation" data-cites="albert_statistical_2002 newman_structure_2003">(<a href="#ref-albert_statistical_2002" role="doc-biblioref">Albert and Barabási 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-newman_structure_2003" role="doc-biblioref">Newman 2003</a>)</span>. An example of an edge list for a simple network is provided in <a href="#fig-edge-list-unweighted" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>.

<p>We take the roundwood trade network for each year of the data as a weighted and directed network, <em>i.e.</em>, we consider whether or not two countries are connected by trade, the direction of the trade flows, and the “weight” (or quantity/value) of the trade flows. In our case, we consider the traded value to be the “weight” of the trade flow. This is in contrast to using the net weight in metric tons, which is not an appropriate unit of volume for roundwood as the mass of the roundwood depends on its moisture content.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Due to data discrepancies, the reported trade value from the exporter and importer of the same trade flow may differ for at least two reasons: (1) import reports are expressed as “cost, insurance and freight” (CIF), while export reports are expressed as “free on board” (FOB), which excludes CIF costs from trade value, leading to bilateral asymmetries; (2) one of the trading partners may not report the trade <span class="citation" data-cites="gaulier_baci_2010 rougieux_forest_2017 kallio_reliability_2018 chen_advancing_2022 mitikj_bridging_2024">(<a href="#ref-gaulier_baci_2010" role="doc-biblioref">Gaulier and Zignago 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-rougieux_forest_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Rougieux et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-kallio_reliability_2018" role="doc-biblioref">A.

<p>Edge lists and any other network objects or raw visualisations are often difficult to read and interpret. Alone, they do not enable a thorough analysis of the structure of a trade network. In order to assess the structural characteristics of trade networks, we computed a series of network metrics for each year, differentiating between exports and imports.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The Python package “networkx” 3.4.2 <span class="citation" data-cites="hagberg_exploring_2008">(<a href="#ref-hagberg_exploring_2008" role="doc-biblioref">Hagberg, Schult, and Swart 2008</a>)</span> is used to facilitate the measurement network metrics.</p>
<p>First, we assess the composition of the trade network. For each year, we compute the total number of nodes in the network, <em>i.e.</em>, the total number of trading countries. These countries are then divided into three more detailed groups: pure exporters (countries that only export roundwood), pure importers (countries that only import roundwood) and mixed countries (countries that both export and import roundwood). To obtain more detailed information on the composition of the network, we then cross-reference the export and import values of each trading country accounting for at least 1% of to the global export or import value with the number of its export and import trading partners. This provides country trade profiles for each year, allowing trade behaviours and groups to be inferred and their evolution observed over time. This set of metrics provides a general overview of the roundwood trade network.</p>
<p>Secondly, to understand the finer details of the network structure, we then computed a set of metrics that assess the connectivity of the trade network, <em>i.e.</em>, the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the number of connections per node <span class="citation" data-cites="albert_statistical_2002 newman_structure_2003">(<a href="#ref-albert_statistical_2002" role="doc-biblioref">Albert and Barabási 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-newman_structure_2003" role="doc-biblioref">Newman 2003</a>)</span>. Again, we assess network connectivity differentiating exports and imports. The mean number of connections per node, or node degree, is an average indicator of the degree of connectedness of the network. A high mean number of connections per node means that each country in the network has, on average, a high number of trading partners. The variance of the number of connections per node provides additional information about the dispersion of the number of connections. If the variance is close to zero, then the nodes in the network have more or less the same degree. A high variance indicates that the degree of connectivity of countries largely deviates from the mean. Skewness provides information about the proportion of low to highly connected nodes in the network. If the skewness is negative, the network consists of a higher proportion of highly connected nodes. Conversely, if the skewness is positive, then the network has a higher proportion of lowly connected nodes. Zero skewness implies an equal ratio of low to high connected nodes. Kurtosis provides information on how the degree distribution compares with a normal distribution in terms of its “tailedness” or “flatness”. A positive kurtosis<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> indicates that tailed outliers are more prevalent than in a normal distribution, meaning countries that diverge from the mean are rare. Conversely, negative kurtosis corresponds to a situation in which outliers are common, <em>i.e.</em>, where most countries diverge from the mean.</p>
<p>Lastly, we assess market concentration by combining our network approach with a traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman market concentration index (HHI). The HHI is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span id="eq-HHI"><span class="math display">\[
HHI = \sum^{N}_{i = 1} (MS_{i})^{2}
\tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of countries involved in trade and <span class="math inline">\(MS_{i}\)</span> the market share of the country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, that is, the ratio of the value traded by country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to the global value traded. We computed two <span class="math inline">\(HHI\)</span>, one for exports and one for imports. The <span class="math inline">\(HHI\)</span> values can range from <span class="math inline">\(1/N\)</span> to 1. According to the <span class="math inline">\(HHI\)</span> value, the US Federal Trade Commission differentiates three types of markets <span class="citation" data-cites="us_department_of_justice_and_the_federal_trade_commission_horizontal_2010">(<a href="#ref-us_department_of_justice_and_the_federal_trade_commission_horizontal_2010" role="doc-biblioref">U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission 2010</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <span class="math inline">\(HHI\)</span> between 0.01 and 0.15 corresponds to an unconcentrated market, <em>i.e.</em>, a market with no anti-competitive effects presumed;</li>
<li>An <span class="math inline">\(HHI\)</span> between 0.15 and 0.25 indicates a moderately concentrated market, <em>i.e.</em>, a market with potential or significant anti-competitive effects;</li>
<li>An <span class="math inline">\(HHI\)</span> greater than 0.25 indicates a highly concentrated market, <em>i.e.</em>, a market with presumption of anti-competitive effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain a more detailed understanding of market concentration, we calculated each country’s annual contribution to the global trade value, <em>i.e.</em>, the reduction in total trade value if a given country were removed from the network. This is equivalent to estimating the share of total trade value that “flows” through a given country in a particular year. Consequently, the sum of all countries’ contributions does not add up to 100%, due to the bilateral nature of trade flows. This approach allows us to identify dominant countries in the roundwood trade. In cases of high market concentration, the removal of a dominant country is expected to result in a substantial loss in trade value.</p>
<p>Combining multiple complementary metrics offers a more comprehensive understanding of the network’s structure than any single metric alone can provide <span class="citation" data-cites="shanafelt_-it-yourself_2017 salau_taking_2022">(<a href="#ref-shanafelt_-it-yourself_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Shanafelt, Salau, and Baggio 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-salau_taking_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Salau et al. 2022</a>)</span>. For example, networks may have the same average number of connections but exhibit vastly different variances, resulting in markedly different topologies. Moreover, we consider our selected set of metrics sufficient for analyzing trade network structure, as many network metrics tend to be correlated <span class="citation" data-cites="baggio_landscape_2011">(<a href="#ref-baggio_landscape_2011" role="doc-biblioref">Baggio et al. 2011</a>)</span>.

<p>Over the study period, the number of countries involved in the roundwood trade fluctuated slightly, ranging from 189 in 1997 to 214 in 2008 and NA (<a href="#fig-network-composition" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). On average, 206 countries were involved in roundwood trade from 1996 to 2023. After a moderate increase in the number of countries involved in trade between 1996 and 2008 (an increase of 11.46%, from 192 to 214 countries), the number of countries stabilised until 2015. From 2015 to 2023, the number of trading countries decreased slightly from 213 to 198 (an 7.58% decrease). Aside from these trends, we found short-term slight decreases in the number of trading countries after 2008, 2015, 2019, and 2021, which, as we will discuss later, can likely be attributed to major global events.</p>
<p>In addition, we can observe several trends in the share of pure exporters, pure importers, and countries that both export and import roundwood. The number of pure exporters has decreased markedly since 1996, falling from 17 to 11 (a decline of around 35%). In 2023, pure exporters represented only 5% of trading countries compared to an average of 6.3% over the studied period. In contrast, the number of pure importers decreased from 52 to 39 between 1996 and 2007 (a decline of 25%), before rising again to 60 between 2007 and 2015 (an increase of 54%). Since 2015, the number of pure importers has stabilised around 60 countries. In 2023, pure importers represented a larger share (29%) of trading countries than pure exporters (23.5% on average over the study period). Throughout the years, there were consistently more pure importers than pure exporters engaged in the international trade of roundwood, with an average difference of 36 countries. The number of countries that both export and import roundwood (“mixed countries”) constituted the vast majority of trading countries (70.2% on average over the studied period, 66% in 2023). The number of mixed countries has increased moderately since 1996, rising from 123 to 138 (an increase of around 12%). As for the total number of trading countries, we noticed short terms drops in the number of pure exporters, pure importers, and mixed countries over the studied period. Some drops are common to pure importers and mixed countries (<em>e.g.</em>, following 2008 and 2019), while others are group-specific (<em>e.g.</em>, following 1997 for pure exporters and 2001 for pure importers).</p>

<p>While 200 countries were involved in the global roundwood trade in 2020, only 31 countries (15.5% of the total) contributed to at least 1% of the export or import value (<a href="#fig-countries-profiles" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>). This suggests a certain degree of market concentration in the trade of roundwood. These 31 countries showed different behaviours, and we identified roughly three groups. First, Asian countries, namely China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Vietnam, form a group of importers. Importers have a higher trade value for imports than for exports and have diversified their import connections more than their export connections. Second, several countries belong to the group of exporters. Their export value is higher than their import value, they have a higher number of export partners compared to their import partners, but their number of export trading partners varies. While Papua New Guinea only export to a limited number of 13 countries, net exporters such as Australia, New Zealand, Congo, Cameroon, Brazil and the Russian Federation, have moderately diversified their number of export trading partners (between 20 and 45). New Zealand,the USA, and the Russian Federation stand out as the world’s three largest suppliers of roundwood. In particular, the USA shows a unique export pattern with a high diversification of its export trading partners (95 export connections). Finally, we can draw a third group of countries that tend to export as much as they import in trade value, with a balanced number of exporting and importing partners. This group is mainly made up of European countries but also includes countries such as Canada and Malaysia.</p>
<p>The trade situation has changed significantly between 2000 and 2020 (<a href="#fig-countries-profiles" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>). In 20 years, China has overtaken Japan as the main importer of roundwood. Japan’s import value decreased dramatically from more than $2.33 billion in 2000 to about $562 million in 2020, a decrease of 76%. On the other hand, China’s import value increased considerably from more than $1.654 billion in 2000 to more than $8.376 billion in 2020, an increase of about 406%. Surprisingly, the number of China’s export trading partners increased sharply by about 129% between 2000 and 2020 (31 new export trading partners), while the value of Chinese export trade decreased by more than $1.2 million on the same period (a decline of about 16%), which seems unlikely. In terms of trade value, New Zealand has emerged as the world’s top exporter of roundwood, while maintaining a relatively stable number of trading partners. Although the USA and the Russian Federation remained major exporters of roundwood, they appeared to be less integrated into global roundwood trade. Between 2000 and 2020, the USA has lost a large share of its trading partners to import (a fall of 42%), while slightly reducing its export diversification (a fall of only 8%). Similarly, the Russian Federation lost 14 export trading partners (25%) and 5 import trading partners (42%) in the same period.</p>

<p>Results for mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the connections per country are presented in <a href="#fig-network-connectivity" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>. Three general observations can be made regarding the average number of connections per country over time. Firstly, both exporters and importers of roundwood observed an increase in their mean connectivity during the first half of the study period (from 1996 to 2008). During this period, mean connectivity of exporters increased by 23% for exporters (from 12.4 to 15.3 connections per exporter), while that of importers increased by 30% (from 9.9 to 12.9 connections per importer). The average number of connections per country then stabilised for exporters. Conversely, mean connectivity of importers decreased by 10% (from 12.9 to 11.6 connections per importer) from 2008 to 2016 and has since stabilised. Secondly, exporters were, on average, 23% more connected than importers throughout the study period (14.2 connections per exporter versus 11.6 connections per importer). The gap widened between the first and second halves of the study period (17% between 1996 and 2008, 27% between 2008 and 2022). Thirdly, aside from general trends, short-term increases and decreases in mean connectivity were observed from year to year, with some shared by both by exporters and importers. For example, mean connectivity of both exporters and importers dropped in the years following 2008, 2016, and 2019.</p>
<p>The variance in the number of connections per node provides additional information on how the connectivity of each country diverges from the overall average. Overall, we observe higher variance in connectivity per country for exporters and importers. Exporters and importers comprise countries with a wide range of trading partners, some of which have a significantly lower number of connections than average (poorly connected countries), while others have a significantly higher number of connections than average (highly connected countries). Variance in the connectivity per country increased for importers from 1996 to 2003 and for exporters until 2010, before decreasing until 2022. Between 1996 and 2005, variance in connectivity per country was, on average, higher for importers than for exporters. This suggests that, during this time period, importers showed greater spread in connectivity compared to the mean. After 2005, exporters and importers displayed similar variances in connectivity. Similar short-term increases and decreases to those observed in mean connectivity per node were seen in the variance from year to year.</p>
<p>Skewness provides information about the distribution of highly and poorly connected nodes within a network. Skewness in connections per country is always positive for both exporters and importers, indicating a greater proportion of countries with low to high connectivity. It remained stable on average for both exporters and importers between 1996 and 2005, followed by an increase until 2010 for exporters and until 2013 for importers. Until 2010, the degree of skewness in connectivity was similar for exporters and importers. Since 2010, the skewness in connectivity has become, on average, higher for importers than for exporters, has slightly increased for importers and has decreased moderately for exporters. That is, there was a greater proportion of poorly connected countries among importers than among exporters, which supports and complements our findings regarding the mean number of connections.</p>
<p>Kurtosis indicates whether countries diverge from the mean connectivity in a scarce or abundant manner. During the study period, kurtosis of connections per country remained positive for both exporters and importers. This suggests that countries whose connectivity diverges from the mean connectivity are rarer than those whose connectivity is close to the mean. From 1996 to 2014, skewness of connectivity was higher for exporters than for importers, meaning that exporters diverging from the mean connectivity were, on average, rarer than importers. The reverse was true after 2014. Until 2022, kurtosis of connectivity decreased, while remaining positive. This fall is steeper for exporters than for importers. As with our other network metrics, we observed several short-term fluctuations in skewness and kurtosis over time from year to year, though these were less pronounced.</p>

<p>Between 1996 and 1998, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) initially fell for both exports (a decline of 38%, from 0.18 to 0.11) and imports (a decline of 52%, from 0.21 to 0.1) indicating a rapid shift from moderate to low market concentration in roundwood trade (<a href="#fig-market-concentration" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a>). This decline was followed by an increase in the HHI for exporters until 2006, reaching a HHI of 0.15, before falling again until 2011 and reaching a HHI of 0.08. Market of roundwood exports then remained stable and lowly concentrated until 2022, with an average HHI of 0.08 since 2011. In contrast, market concentration of roundwood imports increased sharply, becoming moderately concentrated after 2009 (HHI of 0.17) and highly concentrated after 2013 (HHI of 0.25). After a steep decline from a HHI of 0.26 to 0.18 between 2015 and 2016, market concentration level recovered the following year to reach a HHI of 0.35. From 2017 to 2021, imports remained highly concentrated, with an average HHI of 0.35, before falling to 0.26 in 2022. On average, over the last decade, imports have remained highly concentrated, whereas exports have remained lowly concentrated for 26 years.</p>

<p>Contributions from individual countries to the total network trade value provide a more detailed picture of market concentration (<a href="#fig-network-contribution" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>). These contributions correspond to the proportion of the network’s total trade value that would be lost if a particular country is omitted from the network, <em>i.e.</em>, the proportion of total trade value flowing through that country. Over the study period, only ten countries contributed at least 5% to the network’s total trade value once. Referring to <a href="#fig-countries-profiles" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>, main contributors to the total trade value can be divided into three groups: importers (China, India and Japan); European countries (Germany, Czechia and Austria); and traditional wood exporters (Canada, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, and the USA).</p>
<p>Among importers, Japan’s share of total trade value decreased considerably from around 44% in 1996 to less than 6% in 2022. On the other hand, India’s contribution increased steadily from around 2% in 1996 to around 16% in 2012, after decreasing to 5% in 2022. Most notably, China’s share of the total trade value increased sharply, from around 4% in 1996 to more than 56% in 2021, before decreasing to 45% in 2022. Together with results from Figures <a href="#fig-countries-profiles" class="quarto-xref">4</a> and <a href="#fig-market-concentration" class="quarto-xref">6</a>, this indicated that around 56% of the total trade value flowed through China in 2021 due to its imports, which is consistent with the high level of market concentration in roundwood imports in over the past decade.</p>
<p>Among European countries, on average, the contribution of Germany and the Czech Republic increased steadily from around 6% and 2% in 1996 to around 14% and 8% in 2022, respectively. In contrast, Austria’s contribution rose only slightly from around 4% to 7% over the same period. These levels of contribution remain relatively low compared to those of main importers such as China.</p>
<p>Among exporters, the contribution of the USA significantly decreased over the studied period, falling from 33% in 1996 to 13% in 2007. It then stabilized at an average of around 13.7% over the 2007-2022 period. Canada’s contribution to total trade value increased from 5% in 1996 to 11% in 2002, before decreasing to 6% in 2007. It has remained stable since then, averaging around 6.2%. By contrast, New Zealand’s contribution initially slightly fell from 7% in 1996 to 4% in 1998, then stabilised at an average of around 4.4% between 1998 and 2008, before rising significantly to 18% in 2022. On the other hand, Russia exhibits a unique pattern of varying contributions to the total trade value throughout the studied period. Initially, Russian contributions increased from 13% in 1996 to 31% in 2007, before dropping sharply to 12% in 2012. This figure then stabilised at an average of around 11.4% between 2012 and 2018, before dropping again to below 1% in 2022. This correlates with findings presented in <a href="#fig-countries-profiles" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>, which suggests that Russian trade integration has decreased over time. Except for Russia, which appears to be influenced by short-term shocks, all contributors to the roundwood trade exhibit long-term variations in their contribution.</p>

<!--Main result: increasing concentration and resilient structure.-->
<p>Contrary to our expectations, the global roundwood trade network demonstrated significant resilience to exogenous disruptions. Rather than major short-term shifts, the network continued its long-term trend toward a greater concentration and polarization around China, whose market power has grown substantially in recent decades.</p>
<!--Increasing concentration: central role of China, link with Chinese forest policies of the last century, link with urbanization and demand.-->
<p>We found that while the number of countries participating in the roundwood trade network remained relatively stable, its composition changed significantly, with countries engaging more in both imports and exports (Figures <a href="#fig-network-composition" class="quarto-xref">3</a>, <a href="#fig-countries-profiles" class="quarto-xref">4</a>). The network’s connectivity tightened at the turn of the 21st century (<a href="#fig-network-connectivity" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>), a trend consistent with broader globalization <span class="citation" data-cites="prestemon_international_2003">(<a href="#ref-prestemon_international_2003" role="doc-biblioref">Prestemon et al. 2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Our analysis of network connectivity further revealed a consistent structure: a few highly-connected countries (the hubs) dominate trade, a pattern that sharply diverges from the network’s low overall mean connectivity (<a href="#fig-network-connectivity" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>). These hubs play a critical role in the network’s functionality <span class="citation" data-cites="huang_static_2024">(<a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>)</span>, and potentially have huge market power. Many of the major hubs in the international market, such as the USA, Canada, Western Europe, Scandinavia, and Russia, maintained a high number of trading partners throughout the study period.</p>
<p>However, our findings also highlight a significant shift in the trade landscape over recent decades. We observed a decline among traditional core importers and exporters, including Japan, Russia, and the USA, concurrent with the rise of new key players like China and New Zealand (Figures <a href="#fig-countries-profiles" class="quarto-xref">4</a>, <a href="#fig-network-contribution" class="quarto-xref">7</a>). China, in particular, has become <em>the</em> central player in the roundwood trade, substantially increasing its number of import and export partners. By 2021, China’s imports accounted for 56% of the total roundwood trade value, leading to a highly concentrated and polarized import market (Figures <a href="#fig-market-concentration" class="quarto-xref">6</a>, <a href="#fig-network-contribution" class="quarto-xref">7</a>). This confirms findings from other studies <span class="citation" data-cites="long_exploring_2019 zhou_spatial_2021 shen_structural_2022 huang_static_2024">(<a href="#ref-long_exploring_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Long et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-zhou_spatial_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Zhou et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-shen_structural_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Shen and Lovrić 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This could appear as a paradox: despite forest resources being geographically concentrated in a few countries, the roundwood export market is not similarly concentrated. Instead, the import market is highly concentrated, primarily due to demand from China, which paradoxically also possesses the fifth-highest forest endowment and presents the first-highest average annual net gain in forest area <span class="citation" data-cites="fao_state_2024">(<a href="#ref-fao_state_2024" role="doc-biblioref">FAO 2024b</a>)</span>. Indeed, due to Chinese government efforts in spending, as well as China’s market and policy reforms driven by forest conservation demand, China has operated an drastic expansion of its forestry and planted forest extensive margins over the last decades <span class="citation" data-cites="demurger_forest_2009 zhang_chinas_2019 zhao_large-scale_2022">(<a href="#ref-demurger_forest_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Démurger, Yuanzhao, and Weiyong 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-zhang_chinas_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Zhang 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-zhao_large-scale_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Zhao, Wu, and Wang 2022</a>)</span>. However, despite an increase in China’s forest area and volume, low economic tree planting efficiency and poor forest management have resulted in low stand quality and growth rates <span class="citation" data-cites="hoffmann_adapting_2018 hou_intensifying_2019 zhang_chinas_2019">(<a href="#ref-hoffmann_adapting_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffmann, Jaeger, and Shuirong 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-hou_intensifying_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hou, Yin, and Wu 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-zhang_chinas_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Zhang 2019</a>)</span>. As a result, domestic timber consumption — primarily for industrial and construction uses — has outpaced domestic production, making China highly dependent on imported wood products, which now account for approximately half of its total timber supply <span class="citation" data-cites="demurger_forest_2009 he_projection_2011 hoffmann_adapting_2018 hou_intensifying_2019">(<a href="#ref-demurger_forest_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Démurger, Yuanzhao, and Weiyong 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-he_projection_2011" role="doc-biblioref">He and Xu 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-hoffmann_adapting_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffmann, Jaeger, and Shuirong 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-hou_intensifying_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hou, Yin, and Wu 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This overall suggests that roundwood trade flows are predominantly demand-driven rather than supply-pushed. In the case of China, the primary use of wood for industrial and construction uses <span class="citation" data-cites="hou_intensifying_2019">(<a href="#ref-hou_intensifying_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hou, Yin, and Wu 2019</a>)</span> echoes the role of population and urbanization in shaping demand for materials, which has been identified in the literature <span class="citation" data-cites="unecefao_forest_2022-1 mathieu_meta-analysis_2023 villamor_preparing_2024">(<a href="#ref-unecefao_forest_2022-1" role="doc-biblioref">UNECE/FAO 2022b</a>; <a href="#ref-mathieu_meta-analysis_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Mathieu and Roda 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-villamor_preparing_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Villamor, Clinton, and Payn 2024</a>)</span>. Explain a bit more, suggest that this will mechanically attract wood trade flows to regions that are increasing in population and getting urbanised, such as Africa and Asia. Explain that while these regions are (becoming) centers of gravity for wood trade flows, the role of countries may shift. In particular, China seems to initiate a decline in 2022 (<a href="#fig-network-contribution" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>) which could announce the beginning of new phase in the development of the international trade of roundwood. Such decline may be relative to the building of more comprehensive domestic supply chains or to structural mutation, such as the ageing of the Chinese population and the industrial crisis.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal that the network’s excessive reliance on China is a key feature, as its demand drives trade flows and influences global roundwood resource allocation <span class="citation" data-cites="huang_static_2024">(<a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>)</span>. China’s market power is significant enough to exacerbate disruption risks for less-connected countries, redirect trade flows in a competitive environment, and foster trade co-dependence. In fact, China serves as the main trading partner for most major exporters, making them highly reliant on its demand. For example, in 2020, China imported 46% of roundwood exports from the USA, 67% from Russia, 77% from Congo, 78% from Papua New Guinea, and 86% from New Zealand. The case of New Zealand perfectly illustrates this co-dependence. Its rise as a major exporter is closely tied to China’s increasing demand. The share of New Zealand’s roundwood exports to China surged from just 1.2% in 1996 to 89.3% in 2022. This increasing co-dependence raises concerns about a potential “after-China” era for these exporters <span class="citation" data-cites="villamor_preparing_2024">(<a href="#ref-villamor_preparing_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Villamor, Clinton, and Payn 2024</a>)</span>: where would their roundwood go if not to China? To mitigate risks from potential disruptions caused by hubs like China or to limit co-dependence, countries can diversify their trade relationships <span class="citation" data-cites="huang_static_2024">(<a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>)</span>. The United States appears to have pursued this strategy throughout the study period, as shown in our results (<a href="#fig-countries-profiles" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>).</p>
<!--Resilient structure: surprisingly, we expected shocks to affect network structure, but overall network dynamics is driven by long-term trends. Except for Russia: roundwood export ban.-->
<p>While we expected the network to exhibit structural sensitivity to exogenous disruption events, we found that the roundwood trade network was rather resilient to such disruptions and has followed long-term trends over the past decades. Certainly, the network structural metrics showed low to moderate sensitivity to shocks and disruptions. The number of pure exporters, pure importers, and mixed countries, showed slight short-term drops over the studied period (Figure 3). Short-term increases and decreases in connectivity metrics were also observed from year to year. Yet, such shocks seems to only impact the network structure on the short-term,</p>
<p>“From 2002 to 2021, China became a superpower in importing upstream wood forest products, ranking first in import volume […] This achievement indicates that China was highly dependent on wood imports and had strong resistance and recovery capabilities to deal with shocks.”</p>
<!--Network methodology to analyse trade. Europe blurs signals.-->
<p>By considering multiple network metrics, we obtain a clearer picture of the evolution of the network’s structure than using a single metric alone <span class="citation" data-cites="shanafelt_-it-yourself_2017 salau_taking_2022">(<a href="#ref-shanafelt_-it-yourself_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Shanafelt, Salau, and Baggio 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-salau_taking_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Salau et al. 2022</a>)</span>. The mean number of connections gives us a global measure of network connectivity, but tells nothing of the distribution of connections throughout the network. By measuring variance, skewness, and kurtosis we observed changes in the variation of connections per node, the proportion of poorly to highly-connected nodes, and the scarcity or abundance of countries that diverge from the mean connectivity over time. As a complement to traditional market concentration indexes, measuring a country’s contribution to traded value provides a detailed overview of each trader’s relative market power. It is crucial to recognize that network analysis should not be viewed as a replacement for traditional methods but rather as a powerful complement. It offers a macro-level, systemic perspective that can inform and enrich the micro-level insights derived from econometric models or the aggregate flow analyses from gravity models. Such multi-methodological approach would allow to leverage the strengths of each technique, leading to a more holistic and robust understanding of complex trade phenomena.</p>
<!--Limitations-->
<p>However, our results show that, despite the powerful explanatory capacity of network analysis, the quality of the underlying trade data is paramount. The validity and interpretability of the results are directly influenced by the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data, as pointed out in the literature <span class="citation" data-cites="lovric_social_2018 wang_exploratory_2020 zhou_spatial_2021 huang_static_2024">(<a href="#ref-lovric_social_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Lovrić et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-wang_exploratory_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-zhou_spatial_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Zhou et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-huang_static_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Huang et al. 2024</a>)</span>. While network analysis partly deals with data discrepancies by simultaneously taking into account exports and imports, it reveals data discrepancies such as inconsistent reporting, missing values, and outliers <span class="citation" data-cites="kallio_reliability_2018 chen_advancing_2022">(<a href="#ref-kallio_reliability_2018" role="doc-biblioref">A. Maarit I. Kallio and Solberg 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-chen_advancing_2022" role="doc-biblioref">C. Chen et al. 2022</a>)</span>. Hence, our results showed that China exported to 32 more countries in 2020 compared to 2000, while simultaneously reporting a decrease of $1.2 million in export value on the same period (a decline of about 16%), which seems unlikely (<a href="#fig-countries-profiles" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>). This further highlights the caution that should be brought by modelers and data scientists when analysing bilateral trade data, while emphasizes the need for methods to process trade data and correct quality issues or for harmonized and consistent data <span class="citation" data-cites="gaulier_baci_2010 rougieux_forest_2017">(<a href="#ref-gaulier_baci_2010" role="doc-biblioref">Gaulier and Zignago 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-rougieux_forest_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Rougieux et al. 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, our results suggest that the country-level perspective is not always the most relevant in trade analysis. In particular, results highlight the singular trade balance of many European countries, which export as much roundwood as they import. This would suggest to rather consider the European Union as a whole, in order to get a clear vision that is not blurred by individual European countries behaviours and that will better reflect the trade weight of the European continent.</p>
<p>Network analysis capture complexity and describe its organisation but further exploration of the determinants and dynamics are necessary to understand what rule complexity organisation. “To comprehensively analyze the resilience of the global wood and forest products trade network, future research is required to refine and improve the construction of indicator systems.”</p>
<!--For example, our results diverge from the conclusion of Zhou et al. (2021) concerning Japan. While Zhou et al. (2021) showed that Japan’s trade in forest products remained relatively constant from 2000 to 2019 , we observed a net decrease in the number of Japanese trading partners from 59 to 33.
-->
<!-- 
This implies that trade policy should not solely aim for efficiency through specialization but must also prioritize robustness and diversification of supply channels to mitigate the cascading effects of disruptions, thereby moving beyond simple trade volume maximization towards prioritizing structural stability and risk management within global supply chains.
