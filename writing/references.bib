Using event studies around the enactment of regional trade agreements (RTAs) on a panel of 189 countries from 2001 to 2012, we find a large and statistically significant increase in deforestation over the 3 years following the enactment of an RTA, which coincides with an increase in agricultural land conversion. The findings are robust to a variety of controls and fixed effects. The results on deforestation and agricultural land expansion are driven by developing countries in the tropics, suggesting that trade liberalization not only increases net deforestation but may also shift deforestation into ecologically sensitive locations. We find no evidence that these effects are driven by increases in timber harvest. Our results suggest that trade liberalization efforts should be accompanied by policies to direct agricultural land expansion away from forests and sensitive habitat regions.},

            Global value chains (GVCs) require new methods for evaluating interconnections among countries, which can no longer be accurately appraised by standard bilateral gross trade flows. This paper uses tools of network analysis to examine the evolution of value‐added trade from 1995 to 2011. GVCs are very centralised and asymmetric networks, with a few large economies acting as hubs, which exposes them to the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks. As GVCs expanded, the networks of foreign value added in exports became denser, more complex and intensively connected. The regional dimension of GVCs is still dominant but is progressively giving place to a more global network. Networks of foreign value added in goods exports outpace those of services exports. However, foreign inputs of services are important for exports of both goods and services. There is a striking rise of China as a supplier of value added, while Germany and the United States maintain a central role in GVCs over the whole period.},

	abstract = {To promote legal imports of timber and timber products, some countries, such as the United States, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and members of the European Union (EU), have adopted timber trade regulations. The implementation of these regulations is the result of the increase in illegal logging and its negative impact on the environment, biodiversity, and climate change. These regulations play an important role in international trade and are part of an effort to combat illegal logging and its consequences, such as deforestation. This study analyzes the impact of the implementation of these regulations on imports of timber and timber products from timber-producing and timber-processing countries with a significant share of illegal logging over the period 1995–2019. To do so, we use a method combining the gravity approach with a matching technique such as entropy balancing. To test the robustness of our results, we estimate alternative specifications and use alternative methods such as the gravity model and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). We find that the implementation of these regulations has a negative effect on imports of timber and timber products. This reduction in imports is mainly more significant for timber and timber products such as pulp and wood furniture and can also vary according to the country implementing the regulation..},

Using dynamic panel data model and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimations, the analysis addresses endogeneity concerns, such as those stemming from lagged dependent variables, providing robust and unbiased estimates. Results indicate that FSC certification significantly enhances forest cover, with the most pronounced effects observed in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, the study explores how FSC certification interacts with income levels and climatic conditions, revealing region-specific variations in its effects. These findings highlight the importance of market-based conservation tools, such as FSC certification, which align economic incentives with sustainability objectives. The analysis provides practical insights, recommending the integration of FSC certification into responsible trade practices and the development of regionally tailored forest management strategies to maximize conservation outcomes.},

GitHub is an online, cloud-based service that can help researchers track, organize, discuss, share, and collaborate on software and other materials related to research production, including data, code for analyses, and protocols. Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub in ecology and evolution is not widespread. To help researchers in ecology and evolution adopt useful features from GitHub to improve their research workflows, we review 12 practical ways to use the platform. We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty, including storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, writing a manuscript, and using automated and continuous integration to streamline analyses. Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration. As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists establish their workflows using GitHub, the field can continue to push the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.},

	abstract = {Quantitative analysis and forecasting of forest product markets began in the 1950s, based almost exclusively on pure time-series analysis. Since then, considerable improvements have been made in the theoretical basis of the models, the statistical methods of estimation, and the coverage of the data. Especially noteworthy is the exploitation of panel data in the analysis of demand for final products. To model the industry supply of intermediate and final products, however, activity analysis seems more promising than econometrics. It allows for a detailed description of the techniques of production, and, therefore, a better modeling of technical change than the econometric approach. This paper presents a class of models, currently used for policy analysis and forecasting, that present a blend of econometric and mathematical programming, with a dash of system dynamics. Econometrically estimated demand and supply functions are combined with activity analysis of production and transportation, into optimizers to calculate spatial equilibria in multi-product markets. The shadow prices of the optimization are then the key inputs in predicting capacity change by region and process, in system dynamics fashion, and based on Tobin's q theory of investments.},

The parameters were estimated with a large database by ordinary least squares, fixed-effects and random-effects methods. For the three commodity groups, the results were stable across methods. For HS44, exports were inelastic (0.33 ± 0.19) with respect to the gross domestic product (GDP) of exporters and elastic (1.95 ± 0.15) with the GDP of importers. For HS47, exports were elastic with respect to the exporters GDP (1.67 ± 0.55) and importers GDP (1.10 ± 0.36). Exports of HS48 were inelastic with the exporters GDP (0.81 ± 0.21) and elastic with respect to the importers (1.00 ± 0.14). For all three products, there were marked decreases in exports in 2009 and 2012 independent of GDP. The estimated elasticities were used to predict the growth rate of trade flows from 2015 to 2020 based on exogenous GDP projections of the International Monetary Fund. Another application investigated the effects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement on the trade of forest products between the 12 member countries.},

	abstract = {Forest certification plays an important role in the global trade of legal, sustainably harvested timber. There is no accurate definition of how international forest certification systems impact international trade from a global perspective. This paper is intended to evaluate the influence of forest certification on international trade, so that it can provide a scientific basis for the improvement of the international forest certification systems and for the development of relevant forestry industries in different countries. First, the influence of forest certification on international trade of forest products is explained in the economic model; hence, four hypotheses are put forward. Second, to test these hypotheses, we verify the panel data of bilateral trade and forest certification of all forest products among 67 economies from 2009 to 2018 by incorporating forest certifications into the gravity model. Finally, tests by country groups and product groups were further analyzed, respectively. The results show that: (1) The extended Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) estimation solves the problem of the heteroscedasticity and zero trade value problems of the gravity model well in the forest industry. (2) Forest certification has an export competitive effect, a trade barrier effect, as well as common language effect. (3) Forest certification has asymmetric trade effects. The export competitive effect of forest certification in developing countries is greater than that in developed countries. Forest certification has become a trade barrier for developing countries, especially in the process of trade with developed countries. The common language effect is higher during the trade between developed and developing countries. The export competitive effect of wood products is higher than that of furniture products. Forest certification has trade barrier effect on wood products in developing countries, while it has trade barrier effect on furniture products in developed countries.},

Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27\% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26\%), shifting agriculture (24\%), and wildfire (23\%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.},

These data are essential for monitoring change and innovation in the global wood industry. During these five years, global production and trade of most major wood-based products recorded a decline. Global international trade in wood and paper products reached record levels and then dropped off substantially. Global industrial roundwood removals dropped by 4 percent to 1.92 billion m³ in 2023, while global trade decreased by 13 percent to 100 million m³. Sawnwood production in 2023 decreased in all five regions of the world; global trade in sawnwood declined as well. In 2023, paper production declined in Europe and Northern America, while it stagnated in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. It grew only in the Asia-Pacific region. Global production of graphic papers in 2023 (84 million tonnes) was at its lowest level since 1987. Wood pellet production has increased dramatically in the last decades, mainly owing to demand generated from bioenergy targets set by European countries, the Republic of Korea and Japan.FAO launched new data series on a wide range of products including production and trade in engineered wood products (EWPs); trade quantity and value of sawdust; and trade value in secondary processed wood products (e.g., wooden furniture) and secondary processed paper products (e.g., composite paper and paperboard). As well, FAO contributed to the update or revision of all major forest product classification systems. New data and data on emerging products contribute to the monitoring of raw wood material and wood product flows as well as to value chain analyses that support the development of a forest-based bioeconomy.},

	abstract = {In recent years, trade protectionism and unilateralism have prevailed, and countries around the world have imposed restrictions on log exports. It has also become more difficult for China to import wood resources and export deep-processed wood forest products. Based on panel data from 2000 to 2019, this study uses social network analysis to measure the level of the Chinese wood forest product trade network, takes the Chinese free trade agreements (FTAs) as the natural experiment, and uses the multi-stage double-difference method to investigate the impact of the signed FTAs on China’s wood forest product trade. The study finds that the trade network of Chinese wood forest products is becoming increasingly complex, and the central position of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the network is increasing year by year. The signing of FTAs has had a significant positive impact on the trade of wood forest products in China and a significant trade creation effect. This finding remains true after conducting the placebo test and propensity score-matched regression control. At the same time, the import of wood forest products in China will have a significant trade transfer effect due to the signing of FTAs, and this will not affect exports. Although FTAs show significant trade creation and trade transfer effects in China’s wood forest product trade, they also increase, to a certain extent, the mismatch of forest resources worldwide.},

These disruptions impact the forest value chain (FVC) by causing fluctuations in timber supply, from a quantity and quality perspective. This study employed the operational resilience framework (ORF) to assess FVC resilience in five European case studies (CZ, HR, DE, FIN, and ESP), focusing on timber supply as a key system variable. A resilience assessment was conducted using resilience thresholds, considering sustainability from both ecological and economic perspectives. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified three predictor groups that influenced FVC resilience: wood production (WP), harvesting systems (HS), and management and silviculture (MS). Findings revealed that regions with proactive management and sufficient processing capacities (CZ, HR, and ESP) maintained relative stability despite natural disturbances, while others (DE and FIN) experienced prolonged instability due to market-driven logging practices and limited adaptive measures. The study highlighted the frequent breaching of resilience thresholds, particularly during high-volume salvage logging following disturbances such as bark beetle outbreaks, windstorms, and wildfires. The results emphasized the importance of integrating adaptive and proactive strategies to mitigate these impacts. The ORF demonstrated potential for operationalizing FVC resilience and provided guidance for improving preparedness against future disturbances.},

New approaches have been developed to reconcile data reported by almost 150 countries to the United Nations Statistics Division, collated via COMTRADE. When both exporting and importing countries report to Comtrade, we have two different figures for the same flow, so it is useful to reconcile these into a single figure. To do this, firstly, as import values are reported CIF (cost, insurance and freight) while exports are reported FOB (free on board), transport and insurance rates have to be estimated and removed from import values. We regress the observed CIF/FOB ratios for a given flow on gravity variables and a product-specific world median unit value. In a second step we evaluate the reliability of countries reporting. We decompose the absolute value of the ratios of mirror flows using a (weighted) variance analysis. These measures of the reliability of reported data are used as weights in the reconciliation of each bilateral trade flow which is reported twice. Taking advantage of this bilateral information on each flow, we end up with a large coverage of countries and more reliable data, especially in terms of unit-values. BACI is freely available online to users of COMTRADE database, in different product classifications.},

This paper examines forest certification costs of companies, and based on this, uses partial equilibrium to analyze its trade restriction effects, and uses space price gradient field model to check whether it is a substitution for tariff barriers. Our conclusion shows that forest certification has restricted the trade of wood products due to its high certified cost, and clarifies that in the case of tariff reduction, trade of wood products are hindered by different levels and different costs of forest certification. This paper implies that efforts should be made to increase the amount of certified forests worldwide. It is necessary to lower the certified cost and important that government policy measures to support certification should include consideration of who bears the cost, support for aggregation of smallholder growers and improved communication in timber supply chains.},

Nevertheless, despite impressive achievements in forest restoration and conservation efforts, the enhancement of ecosystem services and forest area expansion through plantation development, China was not able to improve its domestic timber supply capacities according to its demands. Consequently, the continually growing wood processing industry is facing a severe demand-and-supply gap, causing high dependencies on timber imports. Outdated forest operations practices, dominated by manual labour, are not able to meet supply demands or to implement new silvicultural strategies for enhancing forest quality and productivity and are a widely unnoted disruption of a sustainable development. Therefore, this review presents the status quo of China’s forest operations sector, how it is shaped by forest policy reforms and recent socio-economic developments. In addition, suggestions are developed how the sector can progress through policy adaptations in order to develop sustainable timber supply capacities based on a domestic plantation sector.},

Our analysis suggests that a crucial pathway is to implement a classified management strategy, whereby a small portion of suitable forestland is dedicated to intensive plantations for producing timber and fiber, while a selective but large part of the other commercial forests will be more effectively managed to provide ecosystem services as well as to produce timber. Increases in growth and yield from these forests will result in positive feedbacks such that a larger amount of remaining forestland can be devoted to other non-timber uses to achieve sustainability nationally. In addition, a substantial portion of forestland has been and will be further set aside as nature reserves, wildlife habitats, and forest parks, etc. To implement this strategy successfully, China must make transform its forestry organizational and governance systems.},

By examining topological features and resilience from 2002 to 2021, this study reveals significant structural evolution and scale expansion in these networks. It finds improvements in network efficiency and resilience, alongside an increase in weighted hierarchy highlighting the prominent roles of core countries like China, the US, and Germany. While these countries bolster network resilience, they also introduce certain vulnerabilities. This study finds notable disassortative mixing without trade volume weights and diversified trends with weights, offering new insights into network dynamics. Core nodes must address disruption risks, enhance diversity, and establish emergency response mechanisms. In the recycling sector, this paper highlights weak trade connections and low resilience, with the US maintaining dominance, China’s influence waning, and India’s rapid ascent. This paper concludes by emphasizing the need for refined indicator systems and deeper explorations into resilience enhancement strategies for operational and targeted suggestions.},

The forest product statistics FAOSTAT by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) are perhaps the most widely used data source for such analyses. This study aimed at systematically scrutinizing this important dataset and identifying regions and product categories where improved data on wood and forest industry production and trade would be needed in order to set the modeling and analyses employing these data on a more solid basis. The consistency of the data on production, imports, and export volumes of wood was examined with some simple tests and with the aid of linear programming. The results show that the data related to the supply of wood chips and particles are unreliable in many countries. Improving these data would be important in order to assess the cascading wood input–output flows, to evaluate resource potentials, and to specify more reliable coefficients for wood use in forest sector models. Moreover, the data show remarkable inconsistencies, even of the magnitude of millions of cubic meters, between the apparent supply of wood (harvests + net imports) and forest industry production in many regions. Errors and uncertainties of such magnitude have important consequences on the results of any analysis using the data and call for special attention by the data users.},

The analysis uses a difference-in-differences approach based on gravity models, with panel data from over 193 countries that trade tropical timber and sawnwood. The result of the analysis shows that the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR) reduces the trade of illegally harvested timber. It further suggests that the EUTR caused a relatively larger reduction in tropical sawnwood (−0.21\%) than that of tropical timber (0.07\%). In addition, the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) appeared to cause a significant reduction in tropical sawnwood (−0.07{\textasciitilde}−0.05\%), whereas tropical timber did not appear to have been significantly impacted. In particular, the reduction in timber exports in countries that have signed the VPA, which aims to encourage exports of legally produced timber, has significant implications for both the EU and timber exporters preparing for the VPA, as both parties strive to expand the VPA. The results of this study suggest that the EU needs to make additional efforts to address the decline in exports from countries that signed the VPA.},

Agricultural trade, hitherto relatively neglected, is found to be one of the main factors causing deforestation. Focusing on the eﬀect of international trade, we show that countries with diﬀerent levels of relative forest cover react diﬀerently to a shock in agricultural exports’ value. We also emphasize that taking countries’ development into account may be critical in assessing global deforestation trends. The impact of trade is high in countries still endowed with a large proportion of forest cover while it is lower in countries with smaller remaining forest cover.},

world consumer expenditures for wood products and producer revenues would rise by 2.2 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. World value added would remain unchanged. However, producer revenues would decrease for the main log exporters (16 percent for the Russian Federation, and 10 percent

In this paper, we use a Muth-type equilibrium displacement model to investigate the market and welfare impacts of this tax, utilizing a vertical linkage between log and lumber markets and considering factor substitution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that, without considering the vertical linkage, the negative effects of log export tax on equilibrium price for log producers is underestimated when logs and processing services are gross substitutes, and the direction of bias is uncertain when they are gross complements. Empirical simulations show that the burden of Russian log export tax is shared almost equally between foreign log buyers and domestic log producers and that the tax increases domestic lumber production. Further, the marginal effect of the log export tax on domestic lumber production decreases as Russian domestic demand share of logs increases. Overall, the welfare gains for Russian lumber consumers, lumber producers in the form of quasi-rents to processing services, and tax revenue exceed the loss in its logging sector.},

Therefore, this study used the complex network method, through using kernel density curves every 5 years to show distribution changes of complex network indictors to study the evolution of the trade network of global trade of wood forest products, based on trade data from 1995 to 2020. The results show that the trade relationship between countries is deepening. Compared with resource-based wood forest products, the trade of deeply processed wood forest products is larger in scale, more complex in structure, and more closely linked. The core countries in global wood forest products trade mainly comprise North American and European countries, while several developing countries in Asia with abundant forest and labor endowments are gradually joining the core tier and jointly control the trade market. We also revealed the intervention of world forestry development goals and national forestry policies on changes to trade structure and trade groups.},

	abstract = {Due to globally uneven distribution of forest resources and timely difference of supply and demand, forest products are difficult to achieve market equilibrium among neighboring countries. The global forest product trade not only alleviates the contradiction of supply and demand, but also ensures the sustainable development of the economic construction for each country. Previous literature analyzed the structure and evolution mechanism of forest product trade from different perspectives, but ignored the competitive relationships among forest product importers. Based on complex network theory, this paper selected global wood forest product trade data from 2004 to 2016. Then we constructed global unweighted and weighted wood-forest-product competitive network from import perspective, and three indicators (density, average path length, and clustering coefficient), core–periphery model and two indicators of competitive intensity were introduced to study the spatial competitive evolution of global wood forest product trade among countries. The results showed that there was wide competition in global wood forest product trade among continents, and the tightness of competitive relationships gradually decreased with time. Secondly, core countries and periphery countries were clearly identified in the competitive network, and China, Japan, the U.S., were the main core countries influencing the evolution of core–periphery structure. Finally, the U.S. played an important role in the global competition system. But with the increment of demand for Asian market, China and other Asian countries gradually became the center of wood-forest-product competition. The research tried to provide some references for importers to follow the laws of global wood forest product trade, and formulate the corresponding policy under constructing sustainable society and facing climate change.},

Heilongjiang Province is a key region for wood production and consumption in China. However, it faces many internal and external challenges in its wood supply chain. This paper uses a system dynamics method to build a wood supply chain model for Heilongjiang Province with Anylogic. It includes resilience factors from infrastructure, economic, and ecological perspectives. The goal is to find the system’s dynamics and how different factors influence and interact with each other. The results show that relying on overseas raw materials makes supply chain management more difficult. Logistics information platforms are essential for better coordination. The manufacturing sector does not respond well, so improving manufacturing efficiency is necessary to increase the system’s efficiency. The sales sector is affected by changes in market demand. Balancing the consumption of domestic and international customer groups can help stabilize production and sales. This study explains the current situation of the wood supply chain in Heilongjiang Province. It provides a theoretical basis for regional wood supply chain management and offers useful insights for improving supply chain resilience in other similar regions.},

	abstract = {Papers on forests and forest products often address sustainability and climate change issues. Wood trade flow models study production and exchanges of wood products in order to better understand and analyze these issues. To date, there has not been a complete overview of these models' objectives, or of the wood trade flow factors they use. We expect wood trade flow models with different objectives to rely on a wide diversity of factors. We performed a meta-analysis on 499 publications about wood trade flow modeling, published between 1972 and 2022 and recorded in the Scopus database. We found that three groups of model objectives constitute most of the literature: understanding trade mechanisms (5\% of the literature), forecasting trends (9\%), and policy analysis (99\%). There is a degree of overlap between these categories, as 14\% of the literature uses wood trade flow models for at least two of the latter objectives. Within the category of models exploring or simulating policies, about 37\% of papers address major economic disruption issues, 40\% concern environmental issues, while 49\% relate to energy, welfare or trade policies. Altogether, these models use a narrow set of four categories of factors: price factors (6\% of the literature), the interdependency of production factors (11\%), policy factors (15\%), and stock and trade quantity factors (49\%), neglecting other possible factors. This study provides the first comprehensive overview and categorization of the models' objectives in relation to their factors. Most importantly, the literature rarely uses certain factors that are considered in other commodities or economic sectors. In particular, the central role of urban dynamics in shaping material trade flows remains unexplored overall by wood trade flow modeling. Compared to the perception of what the driving forces of the forest sector economics have been in recent decades, new issues that have risen require the integration of new categories of factors.},

	abstract = {Accurate trade data remain central for empirical investigations of international trade and informed formulation of trade policies. However, discrepancies in trade reporting, stemming from reasons such as logistics to deliberate misclassification, pose challenges to obtaining an accurate representation of trade activities. This paper provides a systematic examination of these discrepancies by using the Discrepancy Index, a measure of bilateral asymmetry in trade reporting. First, the paper proposes a rich set of country- and product-level indicators that capture both the frequency of misreporting and its impact on the overall recorded trade value. Second, it demonstrates how the Discrepancy Index database can aid analysis and resolve data reliability issues in international trade. This comprehensive data set is used to analyze the general trends in trade data reporting and its reliability, providing empirical insights into the nature and extent of reporting discrepancies. Finally, the paper demonstrates the practical application of the developed discrepancy database and aggregate indicators through case studies of Senegal and the trade relationship between Madagascar and France, shedding light on reporter-specific instances. The paper seeks to equip trade analysts and researchers with tools and resources to make informed decisions on the use of reported trade data and their mirror. In doing so, the study contributes to the broader endeavor of enhancing the reliability of international trade data, thereby contributing to a more accurate empirical investigation of global trade patterns and their policy ramifications.},

The EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) prohibits the placing of illegally harvested timber or timber products on the market. The objective of this paper is to analyse the recent evolution of EU imports of these products from the international market, in order to check how the transparency index of the supplying countries’ institutions and tree cover loss have influenced this trajectory. To that end, a panel data model is estimated with 228 observations from 38 exporting countries between 2012 and 2017. The results show that EU timber imports have a direct association with the transparency index and an inverse relationship with tree cover loss; both these relationships are highly significant at the one-percent level. Other significant factors are the performance of the EU construction sector (as a proxy for timber demand) and timber supply. In the short and medium-term, Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) signed between the EU and non-EU timber-producing countries have a negative influence on the supply to EU member states. This study presents an analysis of EU timber imports after the implementation of the EUTR, providing specific conclusions that can inform policymakers’ efforts to foster sustainable forest management.},

Using a dynamic framework, we estimated import demand elasticities by exporting country and conducted simulations of China’s new tariff exclusion policy for U.S. products. Results indicated that Chinese importers are highly sensitive to U.S. lumber and log prices, which could explain the significant decline in U.S. exports to China when the retaliatory tariffs were imposed. Projections suggest that tariff elimination should benefit U.S. lumber and log exports to China, primarily at the expense of Russian lumber. However, results indicate that China’s new tariff exclusion policy may not be enough to get U.S. forest products back to pre-trade war levels.},

Models are made up of four components: supply, demand, processing, and international trade. We focus on the processing component. Processing component costs are commonly represented by an exogenous average per unit cost and the costs of endogenous inputs; the former costs are, in effect, constant marginal costs of production. We provide both a theoretical basis for and illustrate a method to construct a partial equilibrium model that uses variable marginal costs for production and explicitly includes the cost of endogenous inputs. Through a forest sector model, we also evaluate the implications of using constant as opposed to variable marginal costs to represent the processing component. We demonstrate that coherent processing components can be easily included in existing partial equilibrium models and that variable marginal costs in processing components improve model behavior. We conclude that the constant marginal cost components in forest sector models should be universally replaced with a variable marginal cost.},

Two alternative scenarios are compared to the businessas-usual situation: (1) the US charges 25\% tariff on \$200 billion of goods imported from China, which in return imposes differentiated tariffs on \$60 billion of goods imported from the US; (2) the US raises the tariff rate from 25\% to 30\% and China adds extra tariffs on \$75 billion of imported goods. It is found that China’s imports of sawnwood and waste paper from the US and the US imports of plywood and other paper from China decreased significantly. Meanwhile, some of the trade flows between China and the US shifted to other parts of the world. Vietnam and New Zealand were the largest winners while Thailand suffered a relatively heavy loss. Product substitution occurred mainly in Asia and Europe, and price changes were within 10\%. Overall, China benefited slightly, but the US experienced a loss. These findings have broad policy implications for international trade.},

	abstract = {While many developed countries are increasing their forest cover, deforestation is still rife in the tropics and subtropics. With international trade in forest-risk commodities on the rise, it is becoming increasingly important to consider between-country trade linkages in assessing the drivers of—and possible connections between—forest loss and gain across countries. Previous studies have shown that countries that have undergone a forest transition (and are now increasing their forest cover) tend to displace land use outside their borders. However, lack of comprehensive data on deforestation drivers imply that it has not been possible to ascertain whether this has accelerated forest loss in sourcing countries. To remedy this, we present a land-balance model that quantifies deforestation embodied in production of agricultural and forestry commodities at country level across the tropics and subtropics, subsequently tracing embodied deforestation to countries of apparent consumption using a physical, country-to-country trade model. We find that in the period 2005–2013, 62\% (5.5 Mha yr−1) of forest loss could be attributed to expanding commercial cropland, pastures and tree plantations. The commodity groups most commonly associated with deforestation were cattle meat, forestry products, oil palm, cereals and soybeans, though variation between countries and regions was large. A large (26\%) and slightly increasing share of deforestation was attributed to international demand, the bulk of which (87\%) was exported to countries that either exhibit decreasing deforestation rates or increasing forest cover (late- or post-forest transition countries), particularly in Europe and Asia (China, India, and Russia). About a third of the net forest gains in post-forest transition countries was in this way offset by imports of commodities causing deforestation elsewhere, suggesting that achieving a global forest transition will be substantially more challenging than achieving national or regional ones.},

	abstract = {Forest sector models encompass a set of models used for forest-related policy analysis. As representations of a complex human-environment system, they incorporate multiple facts from their target, the forest sector, which is usually understood as comprising forests, forestry and forest industries. Even though they pursue similar goals and display similarities, forest sector models show divergences in their representation of the forest sector. In this paper, we question and discuss the determinants behind the representation of facts in forest sector models, and try to highlight the reasons behind modelling practices. The forest sector’s boundaries are often unclear, and it comprises facts of different natures for which dynamics take place on different time and spatial scales. As a result, modelling practices vary, and both empirical data and theory play varying roles in representing facts. Early models were developed in the 1970s and find their roots in traditional forest economics, the economics of natural resources, econometrics, but also transportation problems and system dynamics. Because they developed within a small but well-connected field, early efforts were influential in shaping current practices. Numerical simulation and scenario analysis are used as means of enquiry into model worlds: in that, forest sector models are a classical example of model use in economics, and they constitute a good example of how simulation models have been developed for decision-support purposes. Forest sector modelling is heavily influenced by its applied uses, and policy contexts shape both questions asked and how facts are introduced in scenario storylines. Understanding the determinants of modelling choices is necessary to ensure sound modelling practices. Forest sector models are now used to address issues wider than timber production. Practices turn to integration into multi-model frameworks to expand the boundaries of the system studied, but also towards the use of qualitative methods as new ways of representing facts, in particular deep changes that quantitative models may not be able to capture.},

	abstract = {Forests in the European Union grow by 1.2 billion m³ per year. Half of this volume stays in the forest, in particular for sustainable forest management purposes. The other half flows into three industrial sectors: wooden material, paper products and wood energy. These industrial product flows are set into motion and paid for by diverse final consumers. Since 2000, consumption is undergoing important structural changes which cause large disturbances in material, paper and fuel flows. To predict the impact of these changes, economists model relationships between raw material supply, final products demand, prices, production and international trade. This thesis uses panel data econometrics to estimate parameters of empirical models. An introductory chapter sets the policy context of forest resources and forest products of interest at a macroeconomic level. Then I review major forest sector models and I focus on issues encountered while estimating parameters of demand models. A second chapter investigates the potential impact of a trade agreement between the EU and the US on the forest sector. We found that total welfare would increase in the region of the agreement, in addition the agreement benefits more to consumers than to producers. Results show that third party countries are impacted by the agreement too, which highlights the importance of using a global trade model in analysing the impacts of the agreement. In a third chapter I estimate revenue and price elasticities of demand for forest products on a panel of European countries. I deal with non stationarity issues and estimate demand elasticities within cointegrated panels. I demonstrate that revenue elasticities of demand are lower than previous estimates from the literature. Simulations using these robust elasticities in a forest sector model, show a lower demand over a 20 years time horizon. In a fourth chapter, I analyse structural changes in paper products consumption. For this purpose, I use a panel threshold model to estimate the relationship between information technology use and paper products consumption: newsprint, printing and writing paper. I show how paper demand elasticities depend on internet penetration in the population. Thresholds occur once a majority of the population has access to the internet. After the threshold, coefficients between paper consumption and its explanatory variables revenue and price become smaller in absolute terms or even change sign. Based on projections of the number of internet users per country, paper consumption projections could be updated with this type of thresholds models. From a policy perspective, lower demand for graphics paper would free resources and make them available for innovative forest products and services.},

	abstract = {The EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) is a key element in the efforts of the European Union to curb the trade in illegal timber products. This study helps to remedy the lack of systematic, statistical analysis of the EUTR’s potential impacts on international trade in timber products. Using cointegration intervention—or shock—models we quantify potential shifts in import prices and quantities of tropical hardwood lumber and oak lumber after the entry into effect of the EUTR. We further estimate import demand models to assess the relation between temperate and tropical hardwood products and whether there was a structural change in demand elasticities after the entry into force of the EUTR. The shock model analysis indicates, for most of the bilateral trade flows where we observe cointegration and a significant shock variable, increasing import prices and decreasing import quantities of tropical hardwood lumber following the EUTR start date, consistent with a contraction of the supply of tropical timber. The results of the import demand models do not give a clear indication as to whether oak lumber is a complementary or substitute product for tropical hardwood lumber, and there are no clear signs of structural changes in demand elasticities. Aside from the analysis, an important contribution of the paper is the procedure for building a long and homogeneous time series of tropical hardwood lumber.},

to fill a gap and estimate trade and economic impacts of non-tariff barriers and compare them to the impacts of tariffs. Ad-valorem equivalent estimates for a set of well-defined non-tariff trade restrictions are incorporated into a global forest products trade model. Nontariff barriers are
found to be less common than tariffs but have similar or bigger aggregate impacts on trade, production, producer revenues, consumer expenditures and value added as tariffs. There is uncertainty in the estimation of ad-valorem equivalence of non-tariff barriers that serves as a caveat on the
results. Impacts of reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers are often different across regions and products. While not free from uncertainty, the results underscore the importance of analysing both types of trade policy and the need for continuing comprehensive trade liberalization.},

The Russian government recently announced an increase in its export tax on softwood roundwood from the present 6.5\% of export product value to 80\% by January 2009. The effects of this policy on the world forest sector to 2020 were simulated with the Global Forest Products Model. The predicted results were lower Russian roundwood exports and prices, lower global wood supply and higher world roundwood prices. In response, the USA, Germany and New Zealand would increase production and export of roundwood. Major consumers of Russian roundwood would suffer a reduction in production and export of wood products. By 2020 Russian harvests and roundwood exports would be 49 million m3 (19\%) and 51 million m3 (50\%) lower, respectively. The price of roundwood in Russia would be 16\% lower. This would encourage a modest increase in Russian forest product production: 1–3\% higher. However, Russian export revenues would be US {\textbackslash}3.4 billion (23\%) lower as growth in processed exports would fail to offset reduced roundwood export revenue. Value added in all manufacturing sectors would be US {\textbackslash}225 million higher in Russia, while it would be US {\textbackslash}1.3 billion lower in Finland and US {\textbackslash}728 million lower in China. Owing to the tax on exports the Russian forest stock would be 1 billion m3 (0.3\%) higher in 2020.},

	abstract = {Forest fires contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and can negatively affect public health, economic activity, and provision of ecosystem services. In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely human-induced and lead to forest degradation. Studies have shown changing fire dynamics across the globe due to both climate and land use change. However, global trends in fire-related forest loss remain uncertain due to the lack of a globally consistent methodology applied to high spatial resolution data. Here, we create the first global 30-m resolution satellite-based map of annual forest loss due to fire. When producing this map, we match the mapped area of forest loss due to fire to the reference area obtained using a sample-based unbiased estimator, thus enabling map-based area reporting and trend analysis. We find an increasing global trend in forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019, driven by near-uniform increases across the tropics, subtropical, and temperate Australia, and boreal Eurasia. The results quantify the increasing threat of fires to remaining forests globally and may improve modeling of future forest fire loss rates under various climate change and development scenarios.},

The results show that from 2000 to 2020, the global trade network of forest products has been increasingly connected. Compared with the trade of raw material forest products, the trade network of processed forest products is more closely connected and its transport efficiency is higher. Countries with high GDP such as USA, China, and Germany are leading trading countries in forest products. Countries with abundant forest resources are the major exporters of raw forest products, while labor- and capital-abundant countries are major exporters of processed forest products.

It is essential to reveal the structural characteristics of global natural resource supply and demand, which has become one of the most critical factors affecting every country’s policy strategy and economic development. However, mining the characteristics of international natural resource trades is a huge challenge because of the availability and quality of trade data. In this study, the international natural resource trade system is modeled as networks based on the available bilateral trade data from 2000 to 2016. Complex network methods and spatial analysis are utilized to explore the networked and spatial characteristics of different international natural resource trade networks (INRTNs). First, we quantitatively present the overall evolution trend of INRTNs by calculating several indicators of network features at the macrolevel. Then, as the intermediate-level characteristics of INRTNs, the core–periphery structures are explored by applying hierarchical clustering and a visual matrix heatmap. Finally, at the microlevel, the imbalance in direction is detected through the combination of node importance in a complex network with bivariate choropleth maps of spatial analysis. The empirical evidence from INRTNs of different product types in this paper will help governments and business administrations to perceive the complex natural resource trade environment, which can instruct policymakers to formulate effective import–export policies and ensure national resource security and sustainable development.},

Furthermore, market and policy reform have increased the security of forest tenure, and tax reduction and government subsidy have given added incentive for private sectors to invest in forestry. Finally, extra-sectoral factors such as increasing agricultural productivity allow the conversion of some marginal agricultural lands to forestry uses.},

However, the contributions of these programs to forest recovery and land surface greening were generally evaluated on a local scale, which hindered the systematic planning of FCRPs. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of tree cover (TC) change before and after the intensification of FCRPs using the Mann-Kendall test and the Theil–Sen slope estimator. With the improved phenology-based residual trend analysis (P-RESTREND) method, we derived the spatiotemporal patterns of human-induced tree cover (TCH) change on the national scale. Then, we calculated the effectiveness index of FCRPs at the provincial level, based on which the effectiveness levels for the 31 provinces of mainland China were classified. Our study showed that the area of forested lands with a significant greening trend was almost five times larger in the post-intensification phase (1999–2015) than in the pre-intensification phase of FCRPs (1982–1998). More than 29.9\% of the forested lands were significantly improved in TC by human activities in the post-intensification phase. Provinces with high effectiveness levels were generally distributed in humid areas, whereas the majority of provinces with low and moderately low effectiveness levels were spread in arid and semi-arid regions. We concluded that the implementation of FCRPs had contributed greatly to the land surface greening in China. Moreover, the effectiveness of FCRPs in forest recovery was heterogeneous at the provincial level and was driven by multiple natural and socioeconomic factors.},

	abstract = {Clarifying the spatial correlation and driving mechanism of wood-based products trade network is conducive to promoting the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to a higher level. Firstly, we explored the characteristics of spatial correlation and evolution tendency of raw material-type wood-based products trade network (TN-WFPM) and product-type wood-based products trade network (TN-WFPP) from the overall characteristics, centrality, and node coreness of the networks according to social network analysis method. Then we analyzed the driving mechanism of the spatial correlation according to the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP). The results show that, compared with TN-WFPM, the density, reciprocity, and agglomeration of the TN-WFPP are relatively stronger. The centrality and evolution characteristics of RCEP countries are different in the networks. The coreness of China and Thailand in the TN-WFPP has always been in the top two, while the coreness of China, Japan, and Korea has increased significantly and China has been the top since 2010 in the TN-WFPM. Factors like cultural distance, forest resource endowment, forest certification area, economic scale, economic distance, and free trade agreements (FTA) have significant impacts on the spatial correlation of wood-based products trade among RCEP countries. Furthermore, the impacts of different factors on the two kinds of networks are heterogeneous.},

	abstract = {This study uses the tools of network analysis to graphically and analytically represent the characteristics of world trade. The structure of the World Trade Network is compared over time, detecting and interpreting patterns of trade ties among countries. The results show that the trading system has become more intensely interconnected, and trade integration at the world level has been increasing, but it is still far from being complete, with the exception of a few areas. At the same time, we observed a strong and increasing heterogeneity in countries’ choice of trade partners, with countries holding very different positions within the network, so that it is very difficult to talk of a representative country in the international trade system. Network indices were also used in a gravity model regression, adding to the explanatory power of the model. Furthermore, the analysis shows that trade policies do play a role in shaping the trade network, and that WTO members are more closely connected than the rest of the world. The structural difference between the extensive and the intensive margin of trade is also highlighted. An important feature of these results is that they pertain to the trading system as a whole, giving a unified view of the system characteristics and complexity.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, the natural disturbance is increasingly putting pressure on European forests. Shifts in disturbance regimes may compromise forest functioning and the continuous provisioning of ecosystem services to society, including their climate change mitigation potential. Although forests are central to many European policies, we lack the long-term empirical data needed for thoroughly understanding disturbance dynamics, modeling them, and developing adaptive management strategies. Here, we present a unique database of {\textgreater}170,000 records of ground-based natural disturbance observations in European forests from 1950 to 2019. Reported data confirm a significant increase in forest disturbance in 34 European countries, causing on an average of 43.8 million m3 of disturbed timber volume per year over the 70-year study period. This value is likely a conservative estimate due to under-reporting, especially of small-scale disturbances. We used machine learning techniques for assessing the magnitude of unreported disturbances, which are estimated to be between 8.6 and 18.3 million m3/year. In the last 20 years, disturbances on average accounted for 16\% of the mean annual harvest in Europe. Wind was the most important disturbance agent over the study period (46\% of total damage), followed by fire (24\%) and bark beetles (17\%). Bark beetle disturbance doubled its share of the total damage in the last 20 years. Forest disturbances can profoundly impact ecosystem services (e.g., climate change mitigation), affect regional forest resource provisioning and consequently disrupt long-term management planning objectives and timber markets. We conclude that adaptation to changing disturbance regimes must be placed at the core of the European forest management and policy debate. Furthermore, a coherent and homogeneous monitoring system of natural disturbances is urgently needed in Europe, to better observe and respond to the ongoing changes in forest disturbance regimes.},

	abstract = {Graph theory, network theory, and circuit theory are increasingly being used to quantify multiple aspects of habitat connectivity and protected areas. There has been an explosive proliferation of network (connectivity) measures, resulting in over 60 measures for ecologists to now choose from. Conceptual clarification on the ecological meaning of these network measures and their interrelationships is overdue. We present a framework that categorizes network measures based on the connectivity property that they quantify (i.e., route-specific flux, route redundancy, route vulnerability, and connected habitat area) and the structural level of the habitat network to which they apply. The framework reveals a lack of network measures in the categories of “route-specific flux among neighboring habitat patches” and “route redundancy at the level of network components.” We propose that network motif and path redundancy measures can be developed to fill the gaps in these categories. The value of this framework lies in its ability to inform the selection and application of network measures. Ultimately, it will allow a better comparison among graph, network, and circuit analyses, which will improve the design and management of connected landscapes.},

	abstract = {Natural disturbances like wildfire, windthrow and insect outbreaks are critical drivers of composition, structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They are strongly climate-sensitive, and are thus likely to be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest structure and composition associated with management activities such as promoting conifers and increasing standing timber volume (i.e. ‘forest change’) also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here, we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed in the same order of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance damage in Europe's forests. Climate change was the main driver of the increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe's forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss fragments metacommunities, altering the movement of species between previously connected habitat patches. The consequences of habitat loss for ecosystem functioning depend, in part, on how these changes in connectivity alter the spatial insurance effects of biodiversity. Spatial insurance is the maintenance of biodiversity and stable ecosystem functioning in changing environments that occurs when species are able to move between local habitat patches in order to track conditions to which they are adapted. Spatial insurance requires a combination of species sorting dynamics, which allow species to disperse to habitats where they are productive, and mass effect dynamics, where dispersal allows species to persist in marginal habitats where environmental conditions do not support growth. Here we use a spatially explicit metacommunity model to show that the relative contribution of species sorting and mass effects to spatial insurance changes with the rate of dispersal. We then simulate different sequences of habitat loss by removing habitat patches based on their betweenness centrality (the degree to which a patch serves as a connection between other patches in the metacommunity). We demonstrate that the sequence of habitat loss has a large, non-linear impact on diversity, ecosystem functioning and stability. Spatial insurance is lost because habitat fragmentation impedes species sorting, while promoting mass effects and dispersal limitation. We find that species sorting dynamics, and thus spatial insurance, are most robust to the removal of habitat patches with low betweenness centrality. These findings advance our understanding of how habitat connectivity facilitates the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and may prove useful for the design of habitat networks.},
